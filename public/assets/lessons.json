Each lesson includes a colorful image, an audio file, full-text, line-by-line translations, and in most cases, an English-Thai vocabulary list.\n\nHere’s how you can use these features to engage students effectively:\n\n1. **Engaging with the Image**: Start by displaying the image that accompanies the lesson. Use it as a visual prompt to encourage students to brainstorm and predict what the story might be about. This step activates prior knowledge and helps students connect new vocabulary to meaningful contexts. Ask them to identify any objects or actions in the image and predict the plot of the story. \n\n2. **Introducing Vocabulary**: Review the vocabulary list provided with the lesson. Use choral repetition to ensure correct pronunciation, allowing students to repeat words after you. You can also practice by asking students to use the new words in simple sentences, helping to solidify their understanding before diving into the story.\n\n3. **Listening Practice**: Play the audio file for the lesson. Encourage students to listen carefully and try to identify the words from the vocabulary list. As the story progresses, you can point to the words as they are spoken, guiding students to match the sounds with the text. This helps build listening comprehension skills.\n\n4. **Understanding the Story**: After the first listen, check that students have grasped the general idea of the story. Have them share what they think happened based on the audio or ask simple comprehension questions based on the story. \n\n5. **Listening with Full-Text**: Play the audio again, this time having students follow along with the full-text on the screen. Listening while reading helps students make connections between spoken and written English, reinforcing vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure.\n\n6. **Reading Together**: Read the text aloud with your students, focusing on intonation and fluency. Encourage students to mimic your tone, stress, and rhythm. This practice develops their spoken English and helps them understand how language flows naturally.\n\n7. **Using Translations**: Depending on the proficiency level of your students, you may choose to activate the line-by-line translations. This allows students to connect the English content with their native language, facilitating deeper understanding and easing the transition into more advanced comprehension.\n\n8. **Memory Recall**: After completing the reading, hide the text and ask students to recall what they remember about the story. This activity reinforces key vocabulary and concepts, encouraging students to reconstruct the narrative in their own words.\n\n9. **Comprehension Activities**: To solidify learning, you can create handouts with comprehension questions, prompting students to reflect on the story’s details and themes. Alternatively, use mobile platforms like Quizizz or Kahoots to create game-based quizzes that test comprehension and reinforce vocabulary in an interactive way.\n","created":"2024-09-21 05:36:05.206Z","creatorId":"","id":"zwp86skjgb3yca9","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-teacher-tips.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A1","A2","B1"],"title":"02 Teacher Tips","updated":"2024-09-21 05:45:23.206Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/42.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"What is the meaning of life?\n\nHave you ever heard someone answer this question by saying \"42?\"\nThe answer \"42\" is indeed a reference to Douglas Adams' science fiction novel \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". In this novel, a supercomputer named Deep Thought is tasked with finding the \"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything\". After seven and a half million years of computation, Deep Thought finally reveals the answer: \"42\".\n\nHowever, there's a twist. Deep Thought admits that while it has computed the answer, it doesn't actually know what the Ultimate Question is. This leads to a humorous and somewhat philosophical situation where the characters have the answer (\"42\") but no idea what the question is.\nThis has since become a popular meme and cultural reference, symbolizing the search for meaning in life. It's often used in discussions about philosophy, life, the universe, and everything in between. The \"42\" joke encapsulates the absurdity of seeking a simple answer to complex questions about existence and purpose.\n\nSo when someone answers \"42\" to a complex or existential question, they're likely referencing this famous piece of science fiction literature. It's a way of saying that life's answers may not always be straightforward or even comprehensible. It's a reminder that sometimes, the journey to find the answers (or even the right questions) can be more important than the answers themselves.","created":"2023-12-15 15:05:31.051Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"sdyprvjs1ab375a","imageUrl":"apps/assets/42.jpeg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1"],"title":"42: The Answer to Everything","updated":"2023-12-26 08:42:42.310Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/50-50.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Have you ever wondered how casinos seem to always have the upper hand, even in games with seemingly fair odds? The secret lies in a concept that could be likened to an \"absorption wall\". While players have limited funds, casinos operate with a vastly larger bankroll. This, combined with the mathematical reality of randomness, gives the house its long-term advantage.\n\nPicture this: even in a perfectly fair coin toss game, where you have a 50/50 chance of winning, streaks of good and bad luck are inevitable. Your winning streak might be exciting, but the casino can weather those short-term losses. Conversely, if you hit a losing streak, your funds are finite –  you'll eventually run out of money and have to quit. The casino, on the other hand, can withstand fluctuations.\n\nThis is the \"absorption wall\" in action. Your finite resources hit a limit, effectively halting your play. Since the odds always slightly favor the house over the long term, the casino ultimately absorbs those losses. It's not trickery; it's simply the way probability and limited funds work against the individual player, giving the house its inherent edge.","created":"2024-03-18 01:37:10.340Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"n1cd5kcbytwpmez","imageUrl":"apps/assets/money-drain.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"50/50 Odds and the House Still Wins","updated":"2024-03-18 01:41:09.536Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"en-789.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"The Thai 789 Survival Show was a reality competition series produced in Thailand that followed a similar format to the popular South Korean survival shows like Produce 101.

One afternoon, while rummaging in the attic, he stumbled upon an ancient tome. Its leather cover was cracked, the pages yellowed, and the strange symbols within danced before his eyes.  \n\nOne faded inscription caught his eye – _\"Sanatio Maxima\"_– The Greatest Healing. Thomas's heart pounded. Could this be true magic? A spell so powerful it could mend any wound, maybe even…he dared not let his mind finish the thought.\n\nLater that night, his parents tucked away, Thomas crept to the kitchen clutching the book. On the chopping block lay the remains of the evening's roast chicken – bare bones and a few stray feathers. This would be his test.\n\nTrembling, he whispered the incantation,  \"_Sanatio Maxima_\". A jolt shot through him. The air crackled with an unfamiliar energy. A blinding light filled the room. \n\nWhen his eyes adjusted, Thomas gasped. The chicken bones were gone, replaced by a plump, feathered chicken! It ruffled its feathers, a bewildered cluck escaping its beak. One chicken became two, then three, then a whole flock, their clucking growing into a deafening squawk. \n\nFeathers flew as the chickens burst from the kitchen, flapping and squawking throughout the house. Up the stairs they zoomed, pecking at paintings and squabbling in corners. \n\nThomas's parents, woken by the ruckus, burst into the kitchen to find a fluffy, feathered frenzy. His mother shrieked, his father gaped. Thomas, in the middle of it all, felt a mix of terror and giddy amazement. This was not exactly what he'd intended.\n\nThe next morning involved hours of chicken wrangling, confused neighbors, and finally, an exasperated visit from animal control. Thomas learned a valuable lesson that day: magic, especially when found in dusty books, is best left untouched.

It emphasizes that while factors like luck and talent play a role, it's our habits that we can control and that ultimately determine our outcomes.\n\nThe speaker highlights the concept of \"identity change\" as a key to habit formation. He suggests that focusing on becoming the type of person who has the desired habits, rather than just trying to change the habits themselves, is more effective. This means aligning your actions with your desired identity, even if the results aren't immediate.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the video for high schoolers:\n\n**Focus on what you can control** - Don't waste time dwelling on things like luck or talent that you can't control. Instead, focus on your habits, which are within your control.\n\n**Start small** - Don't try to overhaul your life overnight. Start with small, achievable habits that you can stick with over time.\n\n**Make it easy** - Design your environment to support your good habits and remove temptations for bad habits.\n\n**Focus on the entry point** - The most important part of any habit is getting started. Master the \"cue\" that triggers your desired behavior, and the rest will follow.\n\n**Think long-term** - Good habits often have delayed rewards, while bad habits have immediate rewards. Keep your eye on the long-term prize to stay motivated.\n\nRemember, it's not about perfection; it's about progress. Small changes, consistently applied, can lead to big results. So, identify the habits you want to build or break, and start taking small steps towards your goals.\n","created":"2024-01-02 01:20:44.845Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"zl2e6nrmjc5q9oj","imageUrl":"apps/assets/habits.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","B1","VIDEO"],"title":"Atomic Habits","updated":"2024-01-03 06:35:00.921Z","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/1gdkBt9it84","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/because-vs-so.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"## Because:\n\n1.

They were searching for food but couldn’t find any. Benny saw their empty baskets but hugged his apple tighter, unwilling to share.\n\nAs Benny sat under a tall oak tree, munching on his apple, a wise old owl named Olive flew down. \"Benny, why are you eating alone?\" Olive asked.\n\nBenny replied, \"This is my apple, and I don’t want to share it.\"\n\nOlive looked at Benny kindly. \"Do you know that sharing can bring more happiness than keeping things to yourself?\"\n\nBenny frowned. \"How can sharing make me happy?\"\n\n\"Watch and learn,\" Olive said.

He hopped over to Sammy and Molly and offered them his apple. Their faces brightened even more.\n\n\"Thank you, Benny!\" they exclaimed, sharing the apple with him.\n\nAs they ate together, Benny realized that the happiness on his friends' faces made him feel better than keeping the apple all to himself.\n\nFrom that day on, Benny always shared what he had, and the meadow was filled with even more joy and laughter.

Maybe you think admitting \"I don't know\" will make you seem less intelligent, or perhaps the fear of struggling in front of others feels overwhelming. If this sounds familiar, you might be tangled up in what's called a \"fixed mindset\" about intelligence, and it could be making your life a whole lot harder than it needs to be.\n\nSee, if you believe that being smart is a fixed trait you either have or you don't, it totally changes the game. Your intelligence becomes something to protect and defend rather than grow and develop. Every question, every concept you don't immediately grasp, can feel like a personal attack. This makes it really tempting to hide any uncertainty, sometimes even resorting to bold guesses or confidently talking about things you don't really understand, just to keep up the image of \"always knowing.\"\n\nThe trouble is, this might work in the short term, but it's a trap!  It limits your ability to tackle new subjects, makes you avoid challenging yourself, and could even strain your friendships. Those with the most amazing potential often get stuck because they're afraid of not looking perfect while they learn.\n\nThe key is to shift from a fixed to a growth mindset. Instead of seeing intelligence as set in stone, see it like a muscle. The more you work it, the stronger it gets! It's okay to not know things at first; it means you have an amazing opportunity to learn.  Start rewarding yourself for the effort of trying new things, for wrestling with complex ideas, and you'll realize it's in the struggle that you actually get smarter.\n\nEmbracing \"I don't know yet\" opens a world of possibility and takes a whole lot of unnecessary pressure off your shoulders.

Wolves and their canine descendants \"make their beds\" by circling, flattening grass, and checking for potential threats like insects or snakes. Circling also lets them align their body with the wind direction for optimal scent detection.\nModern Ritual: Though they don't need to build nests anymore, domestic dogs retain this instinctual behavior. It's like their personal pre-sleep ritual, offering comfort and a sense of security. Some research suggests they might even be checking their surroundings for other dogs.\nObserving Your Dog: While circling is usually harmless, keep an eye out for excessive circling coupled with whining or difficulty settling. This could indicate anxiety or discomfort, so consulting a vet is wise.\n\n### Why do dogs yawn?\n\nMore Than Just Sleepiness: Although yawns can certainly signal drowsiness, in dogs, they often have wider meanings. It can be a way to:\nCalm Down: When facing stressful situations, like new people or exciting environments, dogs yawn to de-escalate and manage their emotions.\nCommunicate: If your dog yawns during playtime or interaction, it might be their way of saying \"Let's take a break.\"\nEmpathy: Interestingly, dogs mimic yawns they see in humans and other dogs, demonstrating a potential for empathy and emotional connection.\n\n### Why do dogs eat grass, poop, or dirt?\n\nMysterious Munching: This behavior can have various explanations, so observing your dog is key.\nNutrient Deficiency: Eating grass might indicate a desire for certain vitamins or minerals not found in their regular diet. Consult your vet about dietary adjustments.\nBoredom or Nausea: Sometimes, dogs eat things out of boredom or to settle an upset stomach. Providing more stimulation and monitoring their food intake can help.\nMedical Issues: Underlying conditions like parasites or digestive problems can also lead to pica (eating non-food items). A vet visit is important if you suspect something serious.\n\n### Why do we call dogs canines?\n\nIt all comes down to ancient Rome! The Latin word for dog is \"canis,\" and \"canine\" is simply its adjective form. This word stuck around in scientific and technical contexts due to its precision. It helped differentiate domestic dogs from their wild relatives in the Canidae family, like wolves, foxes, and coyotes.","created":"2024-01-08 08:25:23.641Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"7cun84qzvglp9qi","imageUrl":"apps/assets/puppy.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","SCIENCE"],"title":"Canine Curiosities (01)","updated":"2024-01-08 08:32:29.324Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/new-year.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"How do you celebrate the New Year?\n\n- \"I celebrate the new year with my family and friends in New York City.

Cognitive biases are more like mental shortcuts. They're ingrained tendencies in how we process information, influenced by things like our emotions, experiences, and even our evolutionary history. These biases can distort how we perceive evidence, weigh risks, or make decisions. For instance, the confirmation bias leads us to favor information that confirms our existing beliefs, while the availability bias makes us judge the likelihood of events based on how easily we can recall examples.\n\nLogical fallacies, on the other hand, are errors in the structure of arguments. They're flaws in reasoning that render an argument unconvincing, regardless of the believability of its content. Fallacies often involve misleading comparisons (straw man fallacy), irrelevant appeals to authority (ad hominem fallacy), or reaching illogical conclusions that don't follow from the evidence presented (post hoc fallacy). Unlike cognitive biases, which are unconscious tendencies, fallacies are usually conscious attempts to persuade, even if they rely on faulty reasoning.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between these two is crucial for clear thinking. Cognitive biases are built-in and can be difficult to overcome entirely. However, by being aware of them, we can strive to be more objective in our thinking. Logical fallacies, on the other hand, can be identified and exposed through critical analysis of arguments. By recognizing these flaws, we can avoid being misled and make sounder judgments.\n","created":"2024-03-11 07:22:17.033Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"q9a96sufhjusr0o","imageUrl":"apps/assets/thinking.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Cognitive Bias or Logical Fallacy?","updated":"2024-03-11 07:26:54.741Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/confirmation-bias.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Confirmation bias is a tricky mental shortcut our brains use to navigate the overwhelming amount of information we encounter daily. It means we have a natural tendency to prefer information that aligns with what we already believe, often causing us to ignore or downplay facts that don't fit neatly into our worldview. This bias works in subtle ways. We might gravitate towards news sources that validate our opinions, interpret neutral events in ways that support our perspective, or easily recall times when someone's actions confirmed our preconceived notions about them.\n\nUnfortunately, confirmation bias has very real consequences. It can leave us misinformed about important issues like politics, where we might only consume media that matches our existing affiliations. It can polarize debates like climate change, leading to the dismissal of compelling evidence that contradicts deeply held views. Even in situations as critical as medical diagnoses, doctors could potentially be influenced by confirmation bias, leading them to overlook symptoms that don't initially seem to match their first assumption.\n\nNobody is immune to confirmation bias, but awareness is key. Firstly, accept that we all have biases; it's simply how our brains work.  To combat it, actively seek out diverse viewpoints, even if they make you uncomfortable. Verify information with credible sources, not just those that agree with you. Finally, challenge yourself by trying to argue against your own position – you might uncover weaknesses in your reasoning.\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\n### Understanding the Basics\n\nCan you provide a real-world example (not mentioned in the text) of how confirmation bias might play out?\n\nExplain the difference between the three types of confirmation bias: selective search, interpretation, and recall.\n\n### Going Deeper\n\nIn what ways might confirmation bias be helpful in everyday life?

You've got a mountain of homework, a project due, or that dreaded chore you just *cannot* seem to get started on. Instead, TikTok, Instagram, and gaming seem way more appealing. Procrastination – it's the ultimate teenage nemesis.\n\nBut what if I told you there's a simple (yet slightly gross) trick that can change everything? It's called \"Eat That Frog,\" and it's based on a quote by Mark Twain: \"If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning.\"\n\n**What the Heck Does Eating Frogs Have to Do With Anything?**\n\nThe \"frog\" is your worst task. The biggest, most challenging, or least appealing thing on your to-do list.

There is schoolwork, homework, extracurricular activities, family, friends, and maybe even a part-time job. It can be hard to manage all these responsibilities and still find time to relax and have fun. Finding a good balance between school and life is important to stay healthy, happy, and successful.\n\n### Why is Balance Important?\n\nWhen school takes up too much of your time and energy, you might feel stressed, tired, or even burned out. You might also find it hard to enjoy your hobbies, spend time with friends, or relax with family. But when you find a balance, you can do well in school and still have time to do the things you love. This balance helps you stay focused, motivated, and ready to learn.\n\n### Tips for Balancing School and Life\n\n1. **Make a Schedule:** Plan your day or week by writing down your classes, homework, and activities. Include time for breaks, meals, and fun activities. Having a schedule can help you see how much time you have and keep you from feeling overwhelmed.\n\n2. **Set Priorities:** Decide which tasks are the most important and do them first. If you have a big test coming up, focus on studying before spending time on other activities. It's okay to say no to things that are not as important if you feel you have too much on your plate.\n\n3. **Take Breaks:** Studying for hours without a break can make you tired and less productive. Take short breaks to rest your mind. Go for a walk, listen to music, or talk to a friend. Breaks can help you feel more energized and focused when you return to your studies.\n\n4. **Ask for Help:** If you are struggling with schoolwork or feeling overwhelmed, do not be afraid to ask for help. Talk to a teacher, a school counselor, or a trusted adult. They can offer advice, support, or even extra help with your studies.\n\n5. **Make Time for Fun:** It is important to do things that make you happy. Spend time with friends, play sports, read a book, or just relax. Fun activities help you recharge and feel good about yourself.\n\n6. **Take Care of Yourself:** Remember to eat well, get enough sleep, and exercise. Your body needs to be healthy for your mind to work its best. Taking care of yourself makes it easier to handle stress and stay focused.\n\n### Remember, Balance is Key\n\nFinding the right balance between school and life is not always easy, but it is important. You do not have to be perfect; it is about trying your best to manage your time and taking care of yourself. Remember, it is okay to make mistakes and learn from them. By finding a balance, you can enjoy your high school years and set yourself up for future success.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone's balance looks different. What works for one student may not work for another, and that's okay. The goal is to find a way that helps you feel happy, healthy, and ready to take on whatever comes next!","created":"2024-09-02 00:34:21.687Z","creatorId":"","id":"jkyq37zbgo7b6h5","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-work-life-balance.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Finding Balance: School and Life for High School Students","updated":"2024-09-02 00:35:05.922Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/finny.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"In the vast **ocean** city of **Chicago**, there lived a **fish** named Finny.

He decided to teach Sam about the concept of a \"growth mindset.\"\n\n\"Growth mindset,\" Mr. Johnson explained, \"is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. It's not about how smart you are now, but how smart you can become.\"\n\nSam was intrigued. He decided to give this \"growth mindset\" a try.\n\nThe next day, Sam was faced with a difficult math problem. Instead of giving up like he usually did, he remembered Mr. Johnson's words. He worked on the problem, tried different methods, and even asked for help when needed. After several attempts, he finally solved it.\n\nSam felt a sense of accomplishment. He realized that he was capable of learning and improving. This was his first step towards adopting a growth mindset.\n\nAs days passed, Sam started applying the growth mindset to all his school work. He began to see challenges as opportunities to learn rather than obstacles. He started to enjoy the process of learning and found joy in overcoming difficulties.\n\nHis grades improved, but more importantly, his attitude towards learning changed. He no longer feared making mistakes; instead, he saw them as part of the learning process.\n\nIn the end, Sam learned that a growth mindset was not just about improving his school work.

These ingredients are like the fuel that powers a car, but instead of making the car move, they make electrons flow, which is what powers our lights, phones, and other devices.\n\nInside the battery, there are two main parts: a positive side and a negative side. The positive side is like a pusher, and it pushes electrons towards the negative side. The negative side is like a puller, and it pulls electrons towards itself. This flow of electrons is what electricity is!\n\nNow, how does this pushing and pulling happen? It's all thanks to a special chemical reaction inside the battery. When the battery is used, the ingredients on the positive side and the negative side start to mix, and this mixing process creates the push and pull that makes the electrons flow.\n\nThe strength of the push and pull is measured in volts. A typical AA battery has a voltage of about 1.5 volts, which is like the water pressure in a garden hose. The higher the voltage, the stronger the push and pull, and the more powerful the battery.\n\nAnother important thing about batteries is how much energy they can store. This is measured in milliamp hours (mAh). Think of it like the size of the fuel tank in a car. The higher the mAh rating, the more energy the battery can store, and the longer it will last before needing to be recharged or replaced.\n\nBatteries can be used in many different ways. We can connect them together in different combinations to get the right voltage and power for our devices. For example, we might connect two AA batteries together in series to get 3 volts, or we might connect four AA batteries together in parallel to get more power while keeping the voltage the same.\n\nSo, the next time you use a battery, remember that it's not just a simple piece of metal! It's a tiny container filled with special ingredients that work together to create the electricity that powers our world.","created":"2024-01-01 07:04:43.735Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"extys4n3wvyfyz1","imageUrl":"apps/assets/battery.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","SCIENCE","VIDEO"],"title":"How Do Batteries Work?","updated":"2024-01-01 07:04:43.735Z","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXNKkcB0pI4","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"en-luck-hard-work.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"When we think about success, we often wonder how much of it is due to hard work and skill, and how much is just luck. While hard work and skill are important, luck also plays a role, especially when many people are competing for the same goal. For example, in a big job application pool, two people might have the same skills, but one might get lucky if their application is seen at the right moment.\n\n**What is Luck?**  \nLuck is when something good or bad happens by chance, without any control from you. It’s random and unpredictable, like finding money on the ground or missing the bus. Sometimes, luck brings great opportunities, while at other times, it can lead to unexpected setbacks, such as an illness that prevents someone from achieving their goals, no matter how hard they’ve worked.\n\n**Early Luck and Compounding Effects:**  \nSometimes, lucky circumstances early in life can have a big impact over time. For example, in sports, a child born early in the year is often bigger and stronger than their peers, simply because they are older. Coaches might notice them more, giving them more training and better chances to play, which makes them improve faster. This \"lucky\" start can have a compounding effect, where small advantages build up over time, leading to even greater success.\n\n**Hard Work and Skill:**  \nWhile luck can affect outcomes, hard work and skill are still very important. Working hard means putting in the time and effort to get better at what you do, whether it’s studying, practicing a sport, or learning new skills. People who work hard are often better prepared to make the most of the opportunities they get. However, it’s important to remember that not everyone who works hard will always succeed, because factors outside their control, like luck or unexpected challenges, can also play a big part.\n\n**The Need for Compassion and Giving Back:**  \nBecause luck plays a role, it’s important to be compassionate when we think about success and failure. Not everyone who fails did so because they didn't work hard enough; sometimes, they faced bad luck or obstacles beyond their control. This understanding should encourage us to be kind and supportive to those who are struggling. If you do find success, it's valuable to remember the role that both hard work and luck played and to think about how you can give back. Helping others who face challenges or sharing your resources can make a big difference in someone else’s life.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile you can't control luck, you can control how hard you work and how you react to challenges. But remember, success is not only about effort; it's also about the circumstances we face. Having compassion for others and giving back when you're able are important parts of a balanced and meaningful view of success.","created":"2024-09-03 02:41:34.194Z","creatorId":"","id":"ebq6zfeqnwu0abv","imageUrl":"en-luck-hard-work.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"How Luck, Hard Work, and Skill Affect Success","updated":"2024-09-03 02:44:12.160Z","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&t=21s","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/lexical-sets.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"If you’ve ever wondered why people from different English-speaking regions sound so different, it often comes down to vowel sounds and lexical sets. Let's break down these concepts in a simple way.\n\n#### What Are Lexical Sets?\n\nLexical sets are groups of words that share the same vowel sound in a particular accent. Linguist John C. Wells created a system of lexical sets to help categorize English vowel sounds. Each set is named after a word that represents it, such as KIT, DRESS, and TRAP. These sets make it easier to study and compare accents.\n\n#### Key Lexical Sets and Examples\n\nHere are some common lexical sets with examples:\n\n- **KIT:** Words like \"kit,\" \"bit,\" \"sit\"\n- **DRESS:** Words like \"dress,\" \"bed,\" \"red\"\n- **TRAP:** Words like \"trap,\" \"cat,\" \"bat\"\n- **BATH:** Words like \"bath,\" \"path,\" \"laugh\"\n- **FACE:** Words like \"face,\" \"space,\" \"race\"\n- **GOAT:** Words like \"goat,\" \"boat,\" \"coat\"\n\n#### How Vowel Sounds Differ in Accents\n\nAccents are mainly different because of how they pronounce these vowel sounds. Let’s look at a couple of examples:\n\n- **KIT lexical set:** \n  - In American English, this set is usually pronounced with the vowel sound [ɪ], like in \"sit.\"\n  - In British Received Pronunciation (RP), it’s also [ɪ].\n  - In some Northern English accents, it might sound closer to [ɪ̈] or [i].\n\n- **BATH lexical set:** \n  - In American English, these words are pronounced with [æ], like in \"bath.\"\n  - In RP, they are pronounced with [ɑː].\n  - In Northern English accents, you might hear [a] or [æ].\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nUnderstanding lexical sets helps us see the systematic differences between accents. For example, all words in the BATH set will have the same vowel sound within one accent but might sound very different in another accent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLexical sets and vowel sounds are key to understanding English accents. By comparing how different accents handle the same sets of words, we can better understand and even learn different accents. This is especially helpful for ESL students trying to master pronunciation.

Do you sometimes struggle to focus, communicate, or socialize with others? Do you feel like you are different from most people, and not in a good way?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be neurodivergent. Neurodivergence means that your brain works differently from the typical or expected way. Some examples of neurodivergence are autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and Tourette syndrome.\n\nNeurodivergence is not a disorder, a disease, or a defect. It is a natural variation of human diversity, just like having different eye colors, hair textures, or skin tones. Neurodivergence is part of neurodiversity, which is the idea that all brains are unique and valuable.\n\nBeing neurodivergent can have many advantages, such as being creative, innovative, passionate, or empathetic. However, it can also come with some challenges, especially in a world that is not designed for diverse minds. One of the most common challenges that neurodivergent people face is sensory overload.\n\n## What is sensory overload?\n\nSensory overload is when you feel overwhelmed by the amount or intensity of sensory input around you. Sensory input includes everything that you see, hear, smell, taste, touch, or feel in your body. For example, sensory input can be the sound of a car horn, the smell of perfume, the taste of spicy food, the touch of a sweater, or the feeling of hunger.\n\nMost people can filter out or ignore sensory input that is not relevant or important to them. For example, if you are reading a book, you can tune out the background noise of a TV or a conversation. However, for many neurodivergent people, filtering out sensory input is difficult or impossible. They experience sensory input more intensely or differently than others. For example, they might hear sounds louder, see colors brighter, or feel textures more strongly.\n\nWhen sensory input becomes too much to handle, it can cause sensory overload. Sensory overload can make you feel anxious, stressed, irritable, or confused. It can also affect your ability to think, learn, or communicate. Sensory overload can trigger a meltdown, which is when you lose control of your emotions and behaviors, or a shutdown, which is when you withdraw from the world and become unresponsive.\n\n## How to cope with sensory overload?\n\nSensory overload can be unpleasant and exhausting, but there are ways to cope with it and prevent it from happening. Here are some tips that can help you manage sensory overload:\n\n**Take quiet breaks.** If you feel overwhelmed by sensory input, find a quiet and calm place where you can relax and recharge. You can listen to soothing music, meditate, breathe deeply, or do whatever makes you feel comfortable.\n\n**Use headphones, sunglasses, or other tools.** If you are sensitive to certain sounds, lights, or smells, you can use headphones, sunglasses, earplugs, masks, or other tools to block them out or reduce them. You can also use noise-canceling headphones or apps to create white noise or ambient sounds that can mask unwanted noises.\n\n**Hold or keep a fidget.** If you are restless or need to stim, you can hold or keep a fidget toy, a stress ball, a piece of jewelry, or anything that you can squeeze, twist, or play with. Fidgeting or stimming can help you calm down, focus, or express your emotions.\n\n**Wear comfortable clothing.** If you are sensitive to certain fabrics, textures, or tags, you can wear clothing that is comfortable for you. You can choose clothing that is soft, loose, or smooth, and avoid clothing that is scratchy, tight, or irritating. You can also cut off tags, seams, or buttons that bother you.\n\n**Exercise or stimming.** If you have excess energy or need to release tension, you can exercise or stim. Exercise can help you improve your mood, health, and well-being. Stimming can help you regulate your sensory input, emotions, and behaviors. You can choose any activity that you enjoy, such as running, dancing, jumping, rocking, spinning, or flapping.\n\n**Ask for help or accommodation.** If you are struggling with sensory overload, you can ask for help or accommodation from your family, friends, teachers, or employers. You can explain to them what sensory overload is, how it affects you, and what you need to cope with it. You can ask them to be supportive, understanding, and respectful of your needs. You can also ask them to make some changes in your environment, such as lowering the volume, dimming the lights, or reducing the clutter.\n\n**Use weighted blankets, backpacks, vests, or deep pressure.** If you are feeling anxious, stressed, or overstimulated, you can use weighted blankets, backpacks, vests, or deep pressure to calm yourself down. Weighted items or deep pressure can provide a soothing and comforting sensation that can help you relax and feel secure. You can also hug a pillow, a stuffed animal, or a person that you trust.\n\n## Being unique is beautiful\n\nSensory overload can be challenging, but it does not have to stop you from living a happy and fulfilling life. You can learn to cope with sensory overload and embrace your neurodiversity. Being neurodivergent means that you have a unique and beautiful way of experiencing the world. You have strengths, talents, and gifts that you can share with others. You have a voice, a story, and a purpose that matter. You are not alone, you are not broken, you are not less. You are different, and different is awesome. \n\nIf you want to learn more, you can check out these resources:\n\n- [Reducing Sensory Overload for Neurodivergent Individuals](https://scissortailcs.com/reducing-sensory-overload-for-neurodivergent-individuals/)\n- [Sensory Overload and Emotions](https://neurodivergentinsights.com/blog/sensory-overload-and-emotions)\n- [A few words about neurodiversity in the arts and arts-education contexts](https://blogit.uniarts.fi/en/post/a-few-words-about-neurodiversity-in-the-arts-and-arts-education-contexts/)\n","created":"2024-01-15 06:22:10.422Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"g1j92u1rtym3y3a","imageUrl":"apps/assets/diversity.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","SCHOOL","SCIENCE","VIDEO"],"title":"How to Embrace Your Neurodiversity and Manage Sensory Overload","updated":"2024-01-15 06:38:32.754Z","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/lqQ2ABtRc9Q","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-introversion.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Have you ever heard someone say, \"Oh, they're so shy,\" when what they really mean is that person is introverted? It's a common mistake, but introversion and shyness aren’t the same thing. And being introverted definitely doesn’t mean you lack confidence. Let’s dive into what introversion really means and how it differs from shyness or low self-confidence.\n\n#### What is Introversion?\nIntroversion is a personality trait. People who are introverted tend to feel more energized when they are alone or in smaller, quieter settings. They enjoy their own company and often prefer spending time doing things like reading, drawing, or just relaxing without a lot of external stimulation. It doesn’t mean they don’t like people; they just need more downtime to recharge after socializing.\n\n#### Shyness vs. Introversion\nShyness is more about fear or anxiety around social situations. Someone who is shy may want to be around people, but they feel nervous or awkward when doing so. Introverts, on the other hand, may be perfectly comfortable in social situations but choose not to be in them for long periods because it drains their energy.\n\nFor example, an introvert might enjoy hanging out with friends, but after a few hours, they start to feel tired and want to go home to relax. A shy person might feel nervous even at the idea of hanging out with friends and worry about what others think of them during the event.\n\n#### Introversion and Confidence\nIt’s also important to know that being introverted doesn’t mean you lack confidence. Many introverts are confident and capable; they just express themselves differently. Instead of being loud and outgoing, introverts might prefer to listen and think before they speak. They might take time to process their thoughts and ideas before sharing them. \n\nSome of the most successful people are introverts—famous writers, artists, scientists, and even CEOs who prefer to work behind the scenes. Their confidence comes from knowing themselves well and using their strengths to succeed.\n\n#### Embrace Your Introversion\nIf you’re an introvert, that’s not something you need to change. It’s just part of who you are. You can still be social, make friends, and have fun—just in ways that suit your energy and personality. It’s all about finding balance and recognizing that everyone recharges differently.\n\nSo the next time someone calls you shy or assumes you’re lacking confidence because you like your alone time, you can let them know that introversion is simply a different way of interacting with the world. And that’s perfectly okay.\n\n### True/False Questions:\n\n1. Introversion and shyness are the same thing.\n2. Introverts feel more energized after spending time alone or in quiet settings.\n3. All introverts are confident in social situations.\n4. Some successful people, such as writers and scientists, are introverts.\n5. Introverts don’t like people and avoid socializing completely.\n\n","created":"2024-08-21 05:18:41.250Z","creatorId":"","id":"8ty58lslkmqiypd","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-introversion.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Introversion: It's Not the Same as Being Shy or Lacking Confidence","updated":"2024-08-21 05:45:05.040Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/krashen.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Stephen Krashen's Comprehensible Input Hypothesis is a foundational theory in second language acquisition. It proposes that language learners acquire a new language most effectively when exposed to **input that is slightly beyond their current level of understanding (i + 1)**. This input should be:\n\n**Comprehensible:** Meaningful and understandable, allowing the learner to focus on the message rather than the form of the language.\n\n**Interesting and engaging:** Captivating the learner's attention and promoting active listening or reading.\n\n**Low-anxiety:** Creating a supportive and non-threatening environment where learners feel comfortable taking risks and experimenting with the language.\n\nThink of it like building blocks. Learners can't grasp complex structures if they haven't mastered the basics. However, providing only familiar bricks won't challenge them to grow. Comprehensible input bridges this gap, offering small but achievable steps beyond their current level, promoting natural language acquisition.\n\nHere are some key aspects of the hypothesis:\n\n**Acquisition vs Learning:** It distinguishes between \"acquisition,\" the subconscious absorption of language through meaningful interaction, and \"learning,\" the conscious study of grammar rules and vocabulary. Krashen argues that comprehensible input drives acquisition, while conscious learning plays a supportive role.\n\n**The Affective Filter:** This metaphorical filter represents emotional blocks that can hinder acquisition. When anxiety or negative emotions are high, the filter restricts input flow. Comprehensible input aims to create a low-anxiety environment, lowering the filter and allowing language to flow in naturally.\n\n**Natural Order:** Acquisition progresses through predictable stages, regardless of the instructional method. Focusing on comprehensible input ensures learners encounter language features in the order they're most likely to acquire them.\n\nExamples of comprehensible input include:\n\n**Simplified texts adapted to the learner's level**\n\n**Conversations tailored to their interests and needs**\n\n**Exposure to authentic materials with scaffolding (support)**\n\n**Interactive activities that promote understanding and enjoyment**\n\nKrashen's Comprehensible Input Hypothesis has been influential in language teaching, encouraging a shift towards communicative approaches that prioritize meaning and engagement over grammar drills and rote memorization. It's important to note that the hypothesis is not without its critics, who emphasize the importance of explicit instruction and conscious learning strategies. However, it remains a valuable framework for understanding how language acquisition occurs and for designing effective language learning experiences.\n\n","created":"2024-01-03 13:39:15.255Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"mr6o9yh2wagw4lo","imageUrl":"apps/assets/learning.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Krashen's Comprehensible Input Hypothesis Explained","updated":"2024-01-03 13:47:09.694Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"en-liam-growth.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Liam always believed he wasn't good at math. Since childhood, he struggled with numbers and equations, always receiving low grades. By the time he reached high school, he had convinced himself that he would never improve. \"I'm just not a math person,\" he often told himself.\n\nOne day, his math teacher, Mrs. Collins, noticed his frustration. After class, she approached him and said, \"Liam, I can see you're having a tough time. I believe you can get better with the right approach. Have you heard of a growth mindset?\"\n\nLiam shook his head. \"What’s that?\"\n\nMrs. Collins smiled. \"A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed with effort, good strategies, and help from others. It means seeing challenges as opportunities to grow.\"\n\nLiam was skeptical but decided to give it a try. Mrs. Collins gave him a book on growth mindset and suggested he read a little every day. She also offered to help him with extra math practice after school.\n\nSlowly, Liam started changing his approach. Instead of feeling defeated by difficult problems, he began to see them as puzzles to be solved. He learned to ask for help when he needed it and to celebrate small successes along the way.\n\nOne afternoon, while working on a particularly tough math problem, Liam felt his usual frustration rising. But then he remembered Mrs. Collins' words. He took a deep breath and thought, \"I can't do this yet, but I will learn how.\"\n\nWith patience and persistence, Liam worked through the problem, and when he finally solved it, a sense of accomplishment washed over him. He realized that his efforts were paying off. Over the next few months, his math grades steadily improved.\n\nAt the end of the school year, Mrs. Collins called Liam to the front of the class. \"Liam has shown remarkable progress,\" she said. \"He is a perfect example of what a growth mindset can achieve.\"\n\nLiam beamed with pride. He had learned that with effort, persistence, and the right mindset, he could overcome challenges and achieve more than he ever thought possible.\n\nAs he walked out of the classroom, Liam thought about the future. \"If I can get better at math, what else can I improve?\" he wondered, feeling excited about the endless possibilities ahead.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- Believed (เชื่อ)\n- Struggled (มีปัญหา)\n- Numbers (ตัวเลข)\n- Equations (สมการ)\n- Low grades (เกรดต่ำ)\n- Improve (พัฒนา)\n- Tough (ยาก)\n- Approach (วิธีการ)\n- Frustration (ความหงุดหงิด)\n- Growth mindset (แนวคิดการเติบโต)\n- Abilities (ความสามารถ)\n- Intelligence (สติปัญญา)\n- Effort (ความพยายาม)\n- Strategies (กลยุทธ์)\n- Challenges (ความท้าทาย)\n- Opportunities (โอกาส)\n- Skeptical (สงสัย)\n- Celebrate (เฉลิมฉลอง)\n- Small successes (ความสำเร็จเล็ก ๆ)\n- Puzzles (ปริศนา)\n- Solved (แก้ไข)\n- Accomplishment (ความสำเร็จ)\n- Persistence (ความอดทน)\n- Remarkable (น่าทึ่ง)\n- Achieve (บรรลุ)\n- Possibilities (ความเป็นไปได้)","created":"2024-07-28 12:29:29.056Z","creatorId":"","id":"gj9cc1qen14rr5l","imageUrl":"en-liam-growth.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"Liam Develops  a Growth Mindset","updated":"2024-07-28 12:29:29.056Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"var/www/apps/assets/en-broken-vase.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Once upon a time, in a peaceful village, there lived a curious girl named Lila.

One day, she wandered into her grandmother's house, where she saw a beautiful, old vase on a high shelf.\n\nThe vase was painted with delicate flowers and had a shiny glaze. Lila was fascinated and wanted to take a closer look. She carefully climbed onto a chair and reached for the vase. But as she lifted it, her hand slipped, and the vase fell to the floor, shattering into many pieces.\n\nLila's heart sank. She felt terrible for breaking her grandmother's precious vase. She sat on the floor, tears welling up in her eyes. Just then, her grandmother walked in and saw the broken vase.\n\n\"Oh, Lila,\" her grandmother said gently. \"Are you hurt?\"\n\nLila shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"I'm so sorry, Grandma.

Lila learned to be more careful and always to ask for help when needed. Her grandmother taught her that making mistakes is part of learning and growing.\n\nFrom that day on, Lila was more cautious and thoughtful in her actions.

Her eyes are red from weeping, and her cries can be heard from far away, filling the air with a deep sadness.\n\nThe Banshee does not cause death herself, but she serves as a warning that someone is going to die soon.

In some stories, she is seen combing her hair with a silver comb, crying for those who are about to die.\n\nBanshees are said to be the spirits of women who died tragically or had deep sorrow in their lives. They come back to mourn for the families they once cared about or for people who are close to death. In some tales, the Banshee is gentle and caring, feeling sorry for those she warns. In others, she is more frightening, appearing as an old woman with sharp teeth and a terrifying scream.\n\nPeople in Ireland often fear hearing a Banshee's wail, as it is a sound that brings sadness and loss.

It is usually depicted with the body and head of a lion, a goat's head rising from its back, and a tail that ends in a serpent or dragon's head. This mix of animals makes the Chimera a symbol of chaos and terror, a creature of wild and unpredictable power.\n\nThe Chimera was said to breathe fire, making it even more dangerous. It could scorch the land with its fiery breath and attack both people and animals with its sharp claws and teeth. The creature was believed to live in remote, rocky mountains, where it would terrorize nearby villages. Many feared even the mention of its name, believing that the Chimera brought disaster and destruction wherever it went.\n\nAccording to legend, the Chimera was born from the union of two other monsters, Typhon and Echidna, who were known as the \"Father and Mother of Monsters\" in Greek mythology. It was considered a sibling to other mythical beasts like Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of the Underworld, and the Hydra, a serpent with many heads.\n\nThe Chimera was eventually defeated by the hero Bellerophon, who was sent to kill it as a nearly impossible task. With the help of the winged horse Pegasus, Bellerophon was able to fly above the Chimera, avoiding its deadly breath, and shoot arrows to finally slay the beast.\n\nThough the Chimera is long gone in the legends, its name lives on to describe anything that seems strange, unnatural, or made up of different parts. It remains a symbol of chaos, reminding us of the wild and untamed forces that can exist in both the world and our imaginations.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- **Chimera** - คิเมร่า\n- **Fearsome** - น่ากลัว\n- **Mythology** - ตำนาน\n- **Combination** - การรวมกัน\n- **Animal parts** - ส่วนของสัตว์\n- **Lion** - สิงโต\n- **Goat** - แพะ\n- **Serpent** - งูใหญ่\n- **Dragon** - มังกร\n- **Symbol** - สัญลักษณ์\n- **Chaos** - ความวุ่นวาย\n- **Terror** - ความน่ากลัว\n- **Fiery breath** - ลมหายใจไฟ\n- **Remote** - ห่างไกล\n- **Rocky mountains** - ภูเขาหิน\n- **Hero** - วีรบุรุษ\n- **Pegasus** - ม้าเพกาซัส\n- **Defeat** - พิชิต\n- **Monster** - สัตว์ประหลาด\n- **Legend** - ตำนาน\n- **Unnatural** - ผิดธรรมชาติ","created":"2024-08-29 08:27:00.399Z","creatorId":"","id":"eipvcc9a7dj3w9o","imageUrl":"en-lore-chimera.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2"],"title":"Lore: Chimera","updated":"2024-08-29 08:27:00.399Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-lore-djinn.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Djinn, also known as genies, are powerful, supernatural beings made from smokeless fire, living in a world parallel to our own.

They are known for their ability to shape-shift and can move swiftly across great distances. Some djinn are helpful and wise, while others are mischievous or malevolent, seeking to cause harm or chaos. They often use their magical powers to trick or test humans, sometimes granting wishes with hidden costs.\n\nThe lives of djinn are said to be long, and they live in places far away from human eyes — deep deserts, abandoned ruins, or dark forests. They can also become bound to objects, such as lamps or rings, forcing them to serve whoever possesses that object. However, releasing a djinn from such a bond can be risky, as their true nature may be hidden until they are set free.\n\nWhile some djinn serve as protectors, others are known to be possessive, entering a human's body and mind, causing illness or madness. Stories tell of wise scholars or holy men who can control or banish a djinn with the use of sacred words, talismans, or rituals. Yet, even those who master such arts must be wary, for djinn are cunning and not easily controlled.\n\nIn the end, the djinn remain mysterious — beings of smoke and fire, who walk the line between good and evil.

They have sharp eyesight and can fly high in the sky, watching over large areas. Many stories say that griffins guard treasures like gold and jewels, living in faraway mountains or deserts to keep them safe.\n\nGriffins are also seen as wise and noble creatures. They often protect sacred places, kings, or important people.

They are known for their enchanting voices and are often seen sitting on rocks, singing songs that can be heard over the waves. Mermaids have appeared in stories and legends from many cultures around the world, from Europe to Asia.\n\nMermaids are believed to be both kind and dangerous. In some stories, they are gentle beings who help sailors by guiding their ships to safety or rescuing them when they fall into the sea. In other tales, mermaids are said to lure sailors with their beautiful songs, leading them into dangerous waters or even causing shipwrecks. Because of this, many people think of mermaids as mysterious and unpredictable.\n\nMermaids are often shown with long hair and sparkling scales that shine in the sunlight. They can swim very fast and breathe underwater, and they are believed to have magical powers. Some stories say that mermaids can live for hundreds of years, and they are often seen as guardians of the sea, protecting the ocean and its creatures.\n\nIn many legends, there is also a male version of the mermaid called a \"merman.\" Together, they make up the \"merfolk,\" a race of beings who live beneath the waves. While mermaids are most commonly seen in the ocean, some legends speak of them living in lakes or rivers, too.\n\nEven today, mermaids remain popular in books, movies, and art, symbolizing the mystery and beauty of the ocean.

The Phoenix is a creature of immortality and renewal, representing the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.\n\nAccording to legend, the Phoenix lives for hundreds or even thousands of years. When it feels its life is coming to an end, the Phoenix builds a nest of fragrant herbs and branches, then sets it on fire with a burst of flames. Both the nest and the bird burn to ashes, but from these ashes, a new Phoenix is born, young and full of life. This cycle of death and rebirth makes the Phoenix a symbol of hope, renewal, and the power to rise again even after great hardship.\n\nThe Phoenix is said to live in a paradise far away, often in a magical garden or a distant land. It is believed to have a beautiful, melodic song that can heal or bring peace to those who hear it. In some stories, its tears are said to have healing powers, able to cure wounds and illnesses.\n\nMany cultures have their own version of the Phoenix, including Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese myths.

It has the body of a powerful man and the head of a bull, combining human strength with animal ferocity. The Minotaur lived in a large maze called the Labyrinth, built on the island of Crete.\n\nThe Minotaur was born from a curse placed on the king of Crete, King Minos. According to the myth, the queen of Crete, Pasiphae, fell in love with a sacred bull, and the Minotaur was born from this strange union. Because the Minotaur was half-human and half-bull, it could not live with people. King Minos ordered the great inventor Daedalus to build the Labyrinth, a huge and complex maze, to keep the Minotaur trapped inside.\n\nEvery year, King Minos demanded that seven young men and seven young women from Athens be sent to Crete as a tribute. They were put into the Labyrinth to be devoured by the Minotaur. The people of Athens lived in fear until the hero Theseus decided to end this terrible cycle.\n\nTheseus traveled to Crete and entered the Labyrinth with a ball of thread to help him find his way back. He found the Minotaur in the maze and fought bravely, defeating the creature and ending its terror. Theseus then followed the thread back to safety, becoming a hero to his people.\n\nThe Minotaur remains a symbol of strength, power, and the struggle between human and beast.

Born from ancient curses or dark magic, they have haunted human stories for centuries, living in the shadows and feeding on the lifeblood of the living.\n\nA vampire looks much like a human, but there are tell-tale signs. Their skin is often pale, and their eyes may glow red when they are hungry. Their most noticeable feature is their fangs, sharp teeth used to bite into the flesh of their victims and drink their blood. A vampire’s strength is far greater than a normal human’s, and they are incredibly fast and silent.\n\nVampires can heal quickly, making them hard to kill. They do not age and are immune to most illnesses, which allows them to live for hundreds or even thousands of years. However, they have weaknesses. Sunlight burns their skin and can destroy them. Silver and holy symbols, like crosses, can harm them. They also cannot enter a home without being invited in.\n\nMost vampires are solitary creatures, but some form covens or groups for protection or to rule over human cities in secret. They use their powers of charm and persuasion to control humans, feeding on them when needed and erasing their memories to avoid being discovered.\n\nBecoming a vampire usually involves a dark ritual or a bite from another vampire. Once bitten, the person is drained of blood and given vampire blood in return. They then die and are reborn as a creature of the night, forever changed.\n\nVampires have fascinated humans for centuries, with their mix of beauty and danger, power and weakness. They are the stuff of nightmares, lurking just out of sight, always hungry for their next victim.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- **Vampire** - แวมไพร์\n- **Creature** - สิ่งมีชีวิต\n- **Night** - กลางคืน\n- **Hunger** - ความหิว\n- **Blood** - เลือด\n- **Forever** - ตลอดไป\n- **Ancient** - โบราณ\n- **Curse** - คำสาป\n- **Dark Magic** - เวทมนตร์มืด\n- **Shadows** - เงามืด\n- **Lifeblood** - เลือดที่หล่อเลี้ยงชีวิต\n- **Flesh** - เนื้อ\n- **Victim** - เหยื่อ\n- **Feed** - กิน\n- **Strength** - ความแข็งแรง\n- **Heal** - รักษา\n- **Age** - อายุ\n- **Immune** - ภูมิคุ้มกัน\n- **Illness** - โรค\n- **Weakness** - จุดอ่อน\n- **Sunlight** - แสงแดด\n- **Destroy** - ทำลาย\n- **Silver** - เงิน\n- **Holy Symbols** - สัญลักษณ์ศักดิ์สิทธิ์\n- **Cross** - ไม้กางเขน\n- **Harm** - ทำอันตราย\n- **Invitation** - การเชิญ\n- **Solitary** - โดดเดี่ยว\n- **Covens** - กลุ่มแวมไพร์\n- **Protection** - การป้องกัน\n- **Rule** - ปกครอง\n- **Secret** - ความลับ\n- **Charm** - เสน่ห์\n- **Persuasion** - การชักชวน\n- **Control** - ควบคุม\n- **Memory** - ความทรงจำ\n- **Discovered** - ถูกค้นพบ\n- **Ritual** - พิธีกรรม\n- **Reborn** - เกิดใหม่\n- **Nightmare** - ฝันร้าย\n- **Lurking** - ซุ่มอยู่\n- **Victim** - เหยื่อ","created":"2024-08-29 07:27:58.492Z","creatorId":"","id":"kvpaudzn45jdlpj","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-lore-vampires.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2"],"title":"Lore: Vampires","updated":"2024-08-29 08:21:12.937Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-lore-werewolf.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Werewolves, also known as lycanthropes, are shape-shifters who transform from humans into fearsome wolf-like beasts. The change usually happens under the full moon, when a powerful curse or dark magic forces them to abandon their human form and take on the traits of a wolf. In their beast form, they become incredibly strong, fast, and nearly unstoppable.\n\nA werewolf’s appearance in its wolf form is terrifying. They are larger than ordinary wolves, with thick, dark fur, glowing yellow or red eyes, and sharp claws and fangs. Their howl can send shivers down anyone’s spine, and they are known to be fiercely aggressive and nearly impossible to tame. When they return to human form, they often have no memory of what they did as a wolf, making them a danger to those they care about.\n\nThe curse of the werewolf can be spread in several ways. A bite or scratch from a werewolf is the most common cause, but some are born into it, inheriting the curse from their parents. Others may become werewolves by performing ancient, forbidden rituals. Once cursed, the transformation is inevitable whenever the moon is full, although some werewolves learn to transform at will with time and experience.\n\nWerewolves have weaknesses, despite their strength and ferocity. Silver is their greatest enemy; weapons made of silver can pierce their thick hide and cause great pain. They also fear fire and can be trapped by magical barriers or spells. However, they heal quickly, making them hard to kill by ordinary means.\n\nWhile werewolves are often seen as monsters, some legends tell of werewolves who fight against their nature, using their powers to protect the innocent. They are beings caught between two worlds — the human and the beast — forever struggling against the pull of the moon and their own wild instincts.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- **Werewolf** - มนุษย์หมาป่า\n- **Lycanthrope** - ไลแคนโทรป (มนุษย์ที่กลายเป็นหมาป่า)\n- **Shape-shifter** - ผู้เปลี่ยนรูปร่าง\n- **Transform** - แปลงร่าง\n- **Curse** - คำสาป\n- **Dark magic** - เวทมนตร์มืด\n- **Beast** - สัตว์ร้าย\n- **Full moon** - พระจันทร์เต็มดวง\n- **Wolf-like** - คล้ายหมาป่า\n- **Fearsome** - น่ากลัว\n- **Strength** - ความแข็งแรง\n- **Aggressive** - ก้าวร้าว\n- **Howl** - เสียงหอน\n- **Memory** - ความทรงจำ\n- **Inherit** - สืบทอด\n- **Ritual** - พิธีกรรม\n- **Inevitable** - ไม่อาจหลีกเลี่ยงได้\n- **Transformation** - การเปลี่ยนแปลงรูปร่าง\n- **At will** - ตามความตั้งใจ\n- **Weakness** - จุดอ่อน\n- **Silver** - เงิน (โลหะ)\n- **Pierce** - เจาะ\n- **Fire** - ไฟ\n- **Magical barrier** - อุปสรรคเวทมนตร์\n- **Heal** - รักษา\n- **Monster** - สัตว์ประหลาด\n- **Protect** - ปกป้อง\n- **Innocent** - ผู้บริสุทธิ์\n- **Instincts** - สัญชาตญาณ","created":"2024-08-29 07:34:17.329Z","creatorId":"","id":"0uczo0t5t9t89lu","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-lore-werewolf.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2"],"title":"Lore: Werewolves","updated":"2024-08-29 08:21:07.269Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"en-lore-yeti.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"The Yeti, also known as the “Abominable Snowman,” is a mysterious creature said to live in the snowy mountains of the Himalayas.

It is believed to walk on two legs, like a human, and leaves behind large footprints in the snow.\n\nPeople have been telling stories about the Yeti for hundreds of years. Many say that the Yeti is very shy and rarely seen by humans. It is believed to hide in caves or deep in the forests, far from people. Some people think the Yeti is a protector of the mountains, keeping them safe and untouched. Others believe it is a wild, dangerous creature that can attack if it feels threatened.\n\nThe Yeti is often described as being strong and fast, able to move quickly over rocks and through snow. Many explorers and travelers have claimed to see the Yeti or find its tracks, but there is no clear proof that it exists. Scientists have searched for the Yeti for a long time, but most believe it is just a myth or a misunderstanding of other animals like bears.\n\nEven though there is no solid evidence of the Yeti, it remains an important part of the local legends and culture in the Himalayan region.

Tonight, when the moon hangs like a lantern, climb the Whispering Willow. Its moonlight branches will weave you a ladder to your dreams.\"\n\nThe moon gleamed that night, a giant pearlescent pearl. Luna, heart pounding like a drum, climbed the whispering willow. Its branches, kissed by moonlight, turned into a shimmering ladder, reaching high, high, high. Luna climbed, fear turning to wonder as she brushed past shooting stars and sleepy clouds.\n\nFinally, she stood on the moon's rim, its craters filled with dancing shadows. Luna twirled, her laughter echoing like silver bells. Moonbeams tickled her nose, whispering secrets of constellations and stardust.\n\nShe met Moondrop, a mischievous rabbit with fur like lunar ice. Moondrop took her to a garden of singing crystals and bouncing craters. They raced past sleeping meteors and splashed in pools of moonlight.\n\nDays turned into moons, Luna laughing with Moondrop, learning the Moon's language of stardust and silence. But a pang of longing grew in her heart for the fireflies of her village and the stories of her grandmother.\n\nWith a tearful goodbye, Moondrop wove her a ladder of moonlight. Back in her village, the sun smiled as Luna hopped off the willow. Though back on Earth, Luna carried the moon in her heart, its sparkle in her eyes and its whispers in her laughter.\n\nLuna grew up, but never forgot her moonlit adventure. She became a storyteller, weaving tales of lunar rabbits and dancing moonbeams, reminding everyone that even the wildest dreams can reach the moon, if you climb high enough.\n\nAnd on lonely nights, when the moon hung like a lantern, Luna would stand under the Whispering Willow, her eyes twinkling with moonlit memories, a forever visitor to a world woven from dreams and stardust.\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\n1. **Village** - หมู่บ้าน  \n2. **Twilight** - พลบค่ำ  \n3. **Stardust** - ฝุ่นดาว  \n4. **Moon** - พระจันทร์  \n5. **Dandelion fluff** - ปุยดอกแดนดิไลออน  \n6. **Wise woman** - หญิงผู้มีปัญญา  \n7. **Whispering Willow** - ต้นวิลโลว์ที่กระซิบ  \n8. **Moonlight** - แสงจันทร์  \n9. **Ladder** - บันได  \n10. **Craters** - หลุมอุกกาบาต  \n11. **Shooting stars** - ดาวตก  \n12. **Clouds** - เมฆ  \n13. **Wonder** - ความอัศจรรย์  \n14. **Moonbeams** - ลำแสงจันทร์  \n15. **Constellations** - กลุ่มดาว  \n16. **Mischievous** - ซุกซน  \n17. **Lunar** - เกี่ยวกับพระจันทร์  \n18. **Meteor** - อุกกาบาต  \n19. **Longing** - ความโหยหา  \n20. **Storyteller** - นักเล่าเรื่อง  \n21. **Adventure** - การผจญภัย  \n22. **Sparkle** - ประกาย  \n23. **Memories** - ความทรงจำ  \n24. **Visitor** - ผู้มาเยือน  \n25. **Dreams** - ความฝัน\n","created":"2024-01-01 06:43:56.536Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"i5wi37f06ue7mok","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/moon.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","STORY"],"title":"Lunar Rabbits and Dancing Moonbeams","updated":"2024-08-19 08:48:09.534Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"making-chocolate.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Sara loved making hot chocolate on cold days.

The speaker then defines motivation as the desire or impetus to do something, and explains that it can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is when you do something because you enjoy it, while extrinsic motivation is when you do something for a reward.\n\nThe video then goes on to discuss the different factors that can affect motivation. One important factor is the type of motivation you have. Studies have shown that people who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to stick with their goals in the long run. However, extrinsic motivation can also be helpful, especially when you are trying to do something that you find difficult or uninteresting.\n\nThe video also provides some tips on how to increase your motivation. One tip is to focus on making the task more fun. This could mean asking a friend to join you, listening to your favorite music, or breaking the task down into smaller steps. Another tip is to talk to yourself in a positive way. This means telling yourself that you can do it and reminding yourself of your goals.\n\n","created":"2024-01-04 07:28:54.611Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"fr3mr2q8tzc85wf","imageUrl":"apps/assets/motivation.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","VIDEO"],"title":"Motivation: Why it is important, and how to get it.","updated":"2024-01-04 07:32:00.698Z","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/II5h6uJPvvs","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/goalposts.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"The term \"Moving the Goalposts\" is used to describe the act of changing the criteria or standards for acceptance once they have been met, usually to avoid admitting that an opposing point of view has merit.\n\nIn the context of the moon landing, the conspiracy theorist initially sets the goalpost at “The US never landed on the moon. There will be no evidence of a landing.” When presented with evidence, such as photographs of the moon landing, instead of accepting this evidence, the goalpost is moved to “The photos must be fake. There’s no way to prove the landing is real.”\n\nThis is a classic example of “Moving the Goalposts” because the criteria for proof keeps changing. The original claim was that there would be no evidence of a moon landing. However, when evidence is presented, the claim shifts to the photos being fake. This allows the conspiracy theorist to continue denying the moon landing without having to admit they were wrong about the original claim. It’s a form of intellectual dishonesty where the standards for “proof” are arbitrarily adjusted to maintain a particular stance.\n\nThis tactic can make productive discussion difficult, as it prevents a clear, agreed-upon standard for resolving the dispute. It’s often used as a way to protect deeply held beliefs from being challenged by evidence or logic.\n\nIn a fair and honest debate, it’s important to agree on what constitutes valid evidence or proof and to stick to those standards throughout the discussion. If the standards need to be adjusted, it should be done openly and with the agreement of all parties involved. Otherwise, it’s just moving the goalposts.","created":"2024-03-11 06:01:22.157Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"u8ft5gfo7scy5tq","imageUrl":"apps/assets/thinking.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","SCHOOL","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Moving the Goalposts","updated":"2024-03-11 06:41:15.125Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/newt.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Once upon a time, in a lush forest filled with towering trees and vibrant flowers, lived a small newt named Neville.

Unlike bias, which leads to judgments consistently deviating in one direction, noise is more like random scatter. It can be caused by factors like the time of day, a judge or teacher's mood, or the specific way a question or situation is presented. Noise undermines fairness and consistency in many areas. For example, the same insurance case might receive wildly different quotes from different underwriters, or a student's essay might get a lower grade simply because it was assessed at the end of a long grading session. While difficult to eliminate entirely, recognizing noise is the first step towards reducing its impact and creating  fairer, more consistent systems of judgment.","created":"2024-03-08 02:04:45.124Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"d2y996p09ir5ji6","imageUrl":"apps/assets/noise.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Noise","updated":"2024-03-08 02:04:45.124Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/dark.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"This video is a trailer for an animated movie called \"Dark\", about a boy named Orion who is afraid of everything, especially the dark.

It's the reason we see faces in clouds, animals in rock formations, or figures in the flickering of flames. The word itself comes from Greek: \"para\" meaning beside, alongside, or instead of, and \"eidolon\" meaning image or form.\r\n\r\n## Why Does it Happen?\r\n\r\nOur brains are wired to find patterns, order, and familiarity in the world around us. This helps us make sense of complex information and navigate our environment efficiently. Recognizing faces is particularly crucial for social interaction and survival. Our brains are likely a bit overzealous at times, leading us to detect faces even where they aren't. Think of it as a \"better safe than sorry\" approach our brains took throughout evolution.\r\n\r\n### Common Examples of Pareidolia\r\n\r\n**Seeing faces in objects**: The classic example! This might be the \"man in the moon\", a face in a power outlet, or an image in a slice of toast.\r\n\r\n**Auditory pareidolia**: Hearing distinct words or messages within random noise, like in the wind or static.\r\n\r\n**Religious imagery**: People often perceive images of religious figures in natural formations or everyday objects.\r\n\r\n**Rorschach Inkblot Test**: Psychologists may use deliberately ambiguous inkblot patterns to gain insight into a patient's unconscious thoughts and perceptions.\r\n\r\n","created":"2024-03-07 01:09:06.052Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"8djxxr1inlgewwk","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/thinking.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["NON-FICTION","B1"],"title":"Pareidolia","updated":"2024-08-01 09:07:33.736Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/perry.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Perry was not like other pirates. He did not like to plunder and pillage, he did not like to drink rum and grog, and he did not like to wear black and red. Perry loved the color pink. He loved pink so much that he painted his ship pink, he wore a pink hat and a pink coat, and he even had a pink parrot named Pinky.\nPerry’s crew did not mind his pink obsession. They liked Perry because he was kind and generous, and he always shared his treasure with them. They also liked Pinky because he was funny and smart, and he could imitate any sound he heard.\nOne day, Perry and his crew were sailing on the pink sea, looking for a new adventure. They spotted a small island with a tall palm tree. Perry decided to explore the island, hoping to find some pink flowers or pink fruits. He took Pinky with him and left his crew on the ship.\nAs Perry and Pinky walked on the island, they saw a beautiful sight. There was a cave that was filled with pink crystals. The crystals sparkled and shimmered in the sunlight, creating a dazzling display of colors. Perry was amazed by the cave. He had never seen anything so pink and pretty in his life.\nHe entered the cave, eager to see more of the crystals. He picked up one of them and held it in his hand. It felt warm and smooth, like a precious gem. He smiled and said to Pinky, “This is the best treasure ever! We have to take some of these crystals back to the ship!”\nPinky agreed and said, “Squawk! Pink treasure! Pink treasure!”\nThey started to collect some of the crystals, putting them in a sack that Perry had brought with him. They did not notice that they were being watched by a pair of yellow eyes from the shadows.\nThe eyes belonged to a dragon who lived in the cave. The dragon was very proud of his crystals. He had collected them over many years, from different places in the world. He loved his crystals more than anything else. He did not like anyone touching his crystals, especially not a pink pirate and a pink parrot.\nThe dragon decided to teach them a lesson. He roared loudly and breathed out a stream of fire. The fire hit the wall of the cave, causing some of the crystals to fall down and shatter.\nPerry and Pinky heard the roar and saw the fire. They were terrified. They dropped their sack of crystals and ran out of the cave as fast as they could.\nThe dragon followed them, still roaring and breathing fire. He chased them all the way to the beach, where Perry’s ship was waiting for them.\nPerry’s crew saw the dragon and panicked. They grabbed their swords and guns, ready to fight the beast.\nBut Perry had a different idea. He remembered something that he had read in a book about dragons. He knew that dragons were very intelligent and could understand human speech. He also knew that dragons liked shiny things, especially gold.\nHe took off his hat and coat, revealing his pink shirt underneath. He also took off his necklace, which was made of gold coins that he had found on one of his voyages.\nHe waved his shirt and necklace in the air, trying to get the dragon’s attention. “Hey, dragon! Look at this! I have something for you!” he shouted. The dragon stopped roaring and breathing fire. He looked at Perry with curiosity.\n“What do you have?” he asked in a deep voice.\n“I have some gold for you! It’s shiny and valuable, just like your crystals!” Perry said.\n“Gold? Let me see!” the dragon said. He flew closer to Perry, landing on the sand near him. \nPerry showed him his necklace, holding it up to the sun. “See? It’s gold! It’s yours if you want it!” he said.\nThe dragon examined the necklace carefully. He liked what he saw. He liked how it glittered and glowed in the light. He smiled and said, “Thank you, pink pirate! You are very generous!” He took the necklace from Perry and put it around his neck. \nHe looked at Perry again and said, “You can have some of my crystals if you want. They are very pretty, just like your shirt!” He flew back to the cave and brought back a sack full of crystals for Perry. He gave it to him and said, “Here you go! Enjoy your crystals!”\nPerry thanked him and took the sack. He looked at Pinky and said, “See? We made a new friend!” Pinky nodded and said, “Squawk! Pink friend! Pink friend!” They hugged each other happily.\nThe dragon watched them with amusement. He liked them too. He said to them, “You are welcome to visit me anytime you want. I have more crystals to share with you!”\nPerry and Pinky smiled and said, “Thank you, dragon! We will come back soon!” They waved goodbye to the dragon and boarded their ship. They sailed away, happy and content. They had found the best treasure ever. A pink friendship.

Understanding various personality types can significantly enhance your interactions and connections with people from all walks of life. Patrick Bet-David, a behaviorist and HR specialist, introduced the \"STAR System\" for classifying personalities. \"STAR\" is an acronym for Structure, Task, Action, and Relationship—each representing a distinct personality type. Let's delve into the four types:\n\n1. **Structure**: Individuals with a 'Structure' personality crave organization and clarity. They thrive on order and predictability, often excelling in roles that require meticulous planning and adherence to rules.\n\n2. **Task**: 'Task' oriented people are goal-driven and focused on achieving objectives. They are the doers who tackle challenges head-on and are motivated by accomplishments.\n\n3. **Action**: Those who embody the 'Action' type are dynamic and spontaneous. They bring energy and enthusiasm to their endeavors, often inspiring others with their zest for life.\n\n4. **Relationship**: Lastly, 'Relationship' personalities prioritize connections with others. They are empathetic, communicative, and excel in roles that require teamwork and interpersonal skills.\n\nMost individuals exhibit traits from two of these categories, identifying with a primary and secondary type. Recognizing your own personality blend can aid in self-awareness and personal growth.\n\n## Discussion Questions \nDiscuss and answer at least 2 questions with a partner.\n\n### Real-World Application:\n1.\tHow might understanding these personality types improve communication within a team or group setting?\n1.\tDo you think these categories can be helpful for self-understanding? Why or why not?\n\n### Critical Thinking\n1.\tDo you believe people can fit neatly into just one of these categories, or are personalities typically more complex? Explain.\n2.\tAre there any personality types you think are missing from this model? What would you add?\n\n### Beyond the Text\n*\tDo some research into other personality models (like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or the Big Five).

Here are the key features that distinguish pseudoscience from actual science:\n\n**1. Lack of Falsifiability:** Pseudoscientific claims are often unfalsifiable. This means they can't be tested or proven wrong by any experiment or observation. True science embraces the possibility of being disproven.\n\n**2. Reliance on Confirmation Bias:** Pseudoscience often cherry-picks data to support pre-existing beliefs, ignoring contradictory evidence.  True science is constantly testing its own hypotheses and welcomes challenges.\n\n**3. Over-reliance on Anecdotes:** Pseudosciences heavily rely on personal stories and testimonials rather than rigorous, well-controlled studies with large sample sizes.\n\n**4. Lack of Peer Review:** Pseudoscientific ideas rarely undergo the scrutiny of peer review, a process where experts in the field evaluate research before publication. Scientific research is rigorously vetted by other scientists.\n\n**5. Evasion of Skepticism:**  Pseudoscience discourages critical questioning and skepticism. True scientists welcome critical examination of their theories and are always open to refining their ideas.\n\n**6. Use of Vague and Jargon-Laden Language:** Pseudoscience often uses confusing, overly technical, or seemingly impressive language to mask a lack of substance. Science aims for clarity and precision in its terms and explanations.\n\n**7. Lack of Progress and Integration:** Pseudoscience fields don't evolve over time, integrate with other scientific fields, or produce groundbreaking, consistently validated results. Real science continuously builds on itself with new knowledge and revises older concepts.\n\n**8. Appeal to Ancient Knowledge or Authority Figures:**  Pseudosciences often claim their legitimacy stems from ancient wisdom or the pronouncements of supposed experts who lack appropriate scientific credentials. Science relies on modern methods and data, not merely appeals to the past or charismatic leaders.\n\n**Why is it Important to Identify Pseudoscience?**\n\nPseudoscience can be harmful. It can:\n\n* Lead people to make poor choices about their health and well-being.\n* Drain financial resources on ineffective products and treatments.\n* Undermine trust in genuine science and evidence-based decision-making.\n","created":"2024-03-24 09:46:44.501Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"qdxsu8wbqtm5f5a","imageUrl":"apps/assets/science.jpeg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION","SCIENCE"],"title":"Pseudoscience","updated":"2024-03-24 09:53:05.902Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"jake-book-nd.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Jake loved to read books, especially at night.

They loved to explore the forest and have fun with their friends. One day, they decided to go on an adventure and see what was beyond the snowy hills.\n\nThey packed some nuts and berries in their backpacks and set off. They climbed up the hills, jumping over rocks and sliding on the ice. They saw many beautiful sights, like frozen waterfalls and sparkling snowflakes.

This concept often guides journalists to present different viewpoints to ensure fair coverage. However, when this principle is misapplied, it can lead to what's known as false equivalence—a situation where fringe or less credible scientific ideas are given the same weight as well-established scientific consensus, thereby distorting the public's understanding of the facts.\n\n#### What is False Equivalence?\n\nFalse equivalence in science reporting occurs when media outlets present an issue as being more balanced between opposing viewpoints than the evidence supports. This is particularly problematic in science because it can elevate fringe theories, making them appear as equally valid alternatives to well-supported scientific conclusions. \n\n#### Example: Climate Change Reporting\n\nConsider the reporting on climate change. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists—97% or more—agree that climate change is happening and that human activities are the primary cause. However, some reports have given disproportionate attention to the 3% of scientists who are skeptics, creating an appearance of a significant scientific debate where there is largely consensus. This can confuse the public about the actual level of agreement among scientists regarding climate change.\n\n#### Example: Vaccine Safety\n\nAnother instance of false equivalence can be seen in the coverage of vaccine safety. The scientific consensus is that vaccines are safe and effective in preventing disease. Yet, reports that offer equal time to a small number of dissenters who suggest vaccines are unsafe can mislead the public, giving undue credibility to unverified or debunked claims. This can result in vaccine hesitancy, which impacts public health efforts.\n\n#### Addressing the Issue\n\nTo avoid false equivalence, science journalists must be vigilant in how they represent different viewpoints. They should clearly communicate the relative scientific consensus and evidence supporting different positions. This involves:\n- Providing context on the breadth of agreement among experts.\n- Distinguishing between peer-reviewed studies and opinions or anecdotal evidence.\n- Educating the audience about how scientific consensus is built—through rigorous, repeated testing and validation of results.\n\nBy carefully balancing the need to present diverse viewpoints with the responsibility to accurately reflect scientific consensus, journalists can provide the public with clear and factual information. This not only informs but also educates readers and viewers about how science progresses and how conclusions are reached in the scientific community.\n\n### Vocabulary\n\n1. **Balance** - The presentation of opposing views with equal emphasis in reporting to ensure fairness.\n2. **False Equivalence** - A logical fallacy in media coverage that occurs when two opposing opinions are presented as equally credible, despite clear evidence favoring one side.\n3. **Fringe Theories** - Ideas or hypotheses that lack widespread acceptance within the scientific community, often due to insufficient or contradictory evidence.\n4. **Consensus** - General agreement among a group, often used in science to describe the collective agreement on a topic by experts in the field.\n5. **Skeptics** - Individuals who question or doubt accepted opinions, in this context, those who dispute the mainstream scientific opinion.\n6. **Vaccine Hesitancy** - Reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines, often influenced by doubts about safety and efficacy.\n7. **Peer-reviewed** - The process by which scientists evaluate each other's research manuscripts for quality and validity before they are published in a scientific journal.\n8. **Anecdotal Evidence** - Information based on personal accounts, observations, or stories, not necessarily representative or based on scientific analysis.\n9. **Validation** - The process of confirming that something is based on sound or reliable evidence.\n10. **Educate** - To give intellectual, moral, and social instruction, particularly through formal means.\n\n### Short Answer Comprehension Questions\n\n1. What is false equivalence, and why is it problematic in science reporting?\n2. Provide an example of how false equivalence has been applied in the reporting on climate change.\n3. What is the scientific consensus regarding vaccine safety?\n4. Why might journalists present fringe theories alongside well-established science, and what impact can this have on public perception?\n5. Explain how the concept of peer review contributes to scientific consensus.\n6. How should journalists represent different viewpoints to avoid false equivalence?\n7. What role does providing context about the level of agreement among experts play in science journalism?\n8. Discuss how false equivalence in vaccine safety reporting can affect public health.\n9. Define \"skeptics\" in the context of scientific discourse.\n10.

At its core, scientific skepticism is about withholding judgment until there is sufficient evidence to support a claim. Rather than simply accepting ideas based on gut feelings or popular opinion, a scientific skeptic asks critical questions, seeks reliable evidence, and bases conclusions on what is most likely to be true given the current state of knowledge. This method not only strengthens decision-making but also helps filter out misinformation.\n\nOne of the key benefits of scientific skepticism is its ability to minimize bias. Bias often leads us to favor information that aligns with our pre-existing beliefs or emotions, even when that information might not be well-supported by evidence. For example, we might be inclined to believe in a certain health trend because it resonates with our personal values or because it has been widely endorsed by celebrities. However, a scientific skeptic would pause to ask, \"What does the evidence show?\" This step back from emotional investment allows for a more rational approach to decision-making. By focusing on evidence, we reduce the influence of personal biases and make choices that are more objective and better grounded in reality.\n\nScientific skepticism also fosters critical thinking, which is the ability to analyze information deeply and evaluate its validity. Critical thinking requires us to assess the credibility of sources, check the logic of arguments, and consider alternative explanations. This skill is particularly important in an age of information overload, where not all information is equally reliable. A skeptical thinker does not take claims at face value but instead digs deeper to verify whether the evidence holds up. This practice helps prevent the spread of false information and ensures that decisions are informed by the most accurate understanding of the situation.\n\nAnother vital aspect of scientific skepticism is its reliance on informed decisions. Skeptical thinkers do not make decisions based on incomplete or unreliable information. Instead, they seek out the best available data, whether that comes from scientific studies, expert analysis, or real-world evidence. For instance, when confronted with conflicting reports about climate change, a scientific skeptic would look at the consensus among climate scientists, the quality of the data, and the reproducibility of the findings before forming a conclusion. This ensures that decisions are based on the most likely explanation rather than on rumors or unsubstantiated claims.\n\nThis decision-making process is closely related to **Bayesian probability**, a statistical method that helps skeptics evaluate the likelihood of different outcomes based on existing evidence. In Bayesian thinking, we begin with a prior belief about the probability of something being true. As new evidence comes in, we update our belief, adjusting the probability accordingly. For example, if we initially think there's a low chance that a particular health supplement works, but then see strong scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness, we update our belief to reflect a higher likelihood of the supplement being beneficial. This process of constantly refining our beliefs based on new evidence is at the heart of the scientific skepticism approach. It encourages us to be flexible and to continually adjust our understanding of what is true based on the most current data available.\n\nMoreover, this approach helps us remain adaptable, which is crucial in science where new discoveries constantly reshape our understanding of the world. Scientific skeptics recognize that knowledge is never static. While we may be highly confident in some well-established scientific principles, like gravity, we understand that even these concepts could be subject to refinement as new evidence emerges. Therefore, scientific skepticism doesn't reject change but rather embraces it when supported by strong evidence. This adaptability ensures that our decisions are not based on outdated or disproven ideas but are instead informed by the latest and most reliable information.\n\nIn conclusion, adopting scientific skepticism allows us to make better decisions by minimizing bias, promoting critical thinking, encouraging informed choices, and fostering adaptability. By evaluating claims using evidence and adjusting our beliefs as new information becomes available, we make decisions that are more likely to be true based on the current state of knowledge. This careful, evidence-based approach ultimately leads to better, more rational decision-making in both everyday life and complex scientific matters.\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\n1. **Scientific skepticism** - ความสงสัยทางวิทยาศาสตร์  \n2. **Bias** - อคติ  \n3. **Evidence** - หลักฐาน  \n4. **Objective** - เป็นกลาง  \n5. **Critical thinking** - การคิดอย่างมีวิจารณญาณ  \n6. **Credibility** - ความน่าเชื่อถือ  \n7. **Validity** - ความถูกต้อง  \n8. **Reliable** - เชื่อถือได้  \n9. **Informed decision** - การตัดสินใจที่มีข้อมูล  \n10. **Consensus** - ความเห็นพ้องต้องกัน  \n11. **Reproducibility** - การทำซ้ำได้  \n12. **Bayesian probability** - ความน่าจะเป็นแบบเบย์  \n13. **Prior belief** - ความเชื่อก่อนหน้า  \n14. **Update** - ปรับปรุง  \n15. **Likelihood** - ความน่าจะเป็น  \n16. **Flexible** - ยืดหยุ่น  \n17. **Static** - คงที่  \n18. **Refinement** - การปรับปรุง  \n19. **Mitigate** - ลดผลกระทบ  \n20. **Outcome** - ผลลัพธ์  \n21. **Potential** - ศักยภาพ  \n22. **Expert opinion** - ความเห็นของผู้เชี่ยวชาญ  \n23. **Hype** - กระแส  \n24. **Reliable information** - ข้อมูลที่เชื่อถือได้","created":"2024-08-19 08:38:14.289Z","creatorId":"","id":"4zz762xxz6faqdg","imageUrl":"en-scientific-skepticism.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Scientific Skepticism","updated":"2024-08-19 08:38:14.289Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/holmes.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Sherlock Holmes is a very smart man from England.

They were all born on the same day in 1989 to different mothers who were not pregnant when the day began. A wealthy and mysterious man named Sir Reginald Hargreeves adopts them and raises them to become a superhero team called \"The Umbrella Academy.\" Each child has a special ability, except for Vanya, who seems ordinary.\n\nThe siblings grow up in a strict and cold environment. When they become adults, they drift apart and lead their own lives. The story begins when their father, Sir Reginald, suddenly dies, bringing the siblings back together for his funeral. They suspect he might have been murdered, and they start to investigate what happened.\n\nAt the same time, Number Five, one of the siblings who can travel through time, suddenly returns from the future. He brings terrible news: the world is going to end in eight days. He doesn't know exactly how it will happen, but he knows they need to stop it. The siblings reluctantly team up to find out how to save the world.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we learn that Vanya, the \"ordinary\" sibling, actually has the most powerful abilities of all. She was kept in the dark about her powers by their father, who made her believe she was unremarkable to protect everyone. However, Vanya's powers are unleashed when she is manipulated by a man named Leonard, who wants to use her abilities for his own gain. Her powers grow uncontrollably, causing destruction around her.\n\nMeanwhile, two assassins, Cha-Cha and Hazel, are sent from a mysterious organization called \"The Commission\" to kill Number Five and stop him from changing the timeline. Hazel, however, falls in love with a woman named Agnes and begins to doubt his mission.\n\nAs the siblings try to stop Vanya and save the world, they discover that she is the one who will cause the apocalypse. She becomes the White Violin, a powerful force that could destroy everything. In a final confrontation, the siblings try to calm her down, but Vanya accidentally sends a powerful blast toward the moon, causing it to break apart and sending pieces crashing toward Earth.\n\nRealizing they can't stop the apocalypse, Number Five uses his time-traveling power to transport all the siblings back in time, hoping they can change events and save the world in the past. The season ends with them disappearing into a blue light, leaving the viewers with a big cliffhanger about what will happen next.\n\n### Vocabulary \n\n- Sibling - พี่น้อง\n- Adopted - บุญธรรม\n- Powers - พลัง\n- Born - เกิด\n- Wealthy - ร่ำรวย\n- Mysterious - ลึกลับ\n- Father - พ่อ\n- Funeral - งานศพ\n- Murdered - ฆาตกรรม\n- Investigate - สืบสวน\n- Team - ทีม\n- Travel - เดินทาง\n- Future - อนาคต\n- Apocalypse - วันสิ้นโลก\n- Save - ช่วย\n- Abilities - ความสามารถ\n- Protect - ปกป้อง\n- Manipulate - หลอกลวง\n- Destruction - การทำลายล้าง\n- Organization - องค์กร\n- Timeline - เส้นเวลา\n- Confrontation - การเผชิญหน้า\n- Past - อดีต\n- Disappear - หายตัวไป\n- Cliffhanger - จุดที่น่าติดตาม","created":"2024-08-30 06:27:26.472Z","creatorId":"","id":"ljq70w53tse6idm","imageUrl":"en-spoiler-umbrella.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2"],"title":"Spoiler: Season 1 of The Umbrella Academy","updated":"2024-08-30 06:27:26.472Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/tricky.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Subject-verb agreement can be tricky in certain cases. Here are some examples:\n\n**Indefinite pronouns** - These pronouns, such as “everyone,” “someone,” and “anyone,” are singular and require a singular verb. For example, “Everyone is going to the party.”\n\n**Collective nouns** - Collective nouns, such as “team” or “family,” can be singular or plural depending on the context. If the group is acting as a single unit, use a singular verb. For example, “The team is playing well.” If the individuals in the group are acting independently, use a plural verb. For example, “The family are all going their separate ways.”\n\n**Intervening phrases** - Phrases that come between the subject and verb can be confusing. For example, “The book, along with the pen and paper, is on the desk.” Here, “book” is the subject, so the verb should be singular.\n\n**Compound subjects** - When two subjects are joined by “and,” use a plural verb. For example, “The cat and the dog are playing together.”\n\n**Titles and names** - Titles and names that refer to a single entity are singular and require a singular verb.

something’s funny,\nyou might show your teeth, change your breathing,\nbecome weak and achy in some places, and maybe even cry?\nIn other words, why do we do this bizarre thing that is laughter?\nWhen you laugh, your abdominal muscles contract rapidly.\nThis alters your breathing patterns,\nincreasing the pressure in your chest cavity, and pushing air out,\nwhich might audibly emerge as a snort, wheeze, or vocalization.\nBecause you’re exerting your abdominal muscles much more\nthan you usually would while talking,\nthey may start to hurt.\nLaughter also inhibits your reflexes and muscle control,\ncausing sensations like leg weakness.\nSo, where does this funny phenomenon come from?\nBecause there’s no archaeological record of laughter,\nit’s impossible to say exactly how and why it evolved,\nbut scientists have some theories.\nImportantly, humans are not the only animals today\nthat do something like laughter.\nUsing ultrasonic recorders,\nresearchers in the late 90s realized that rats were basically giggling\nwhile being tickled.\nScientists have since compiled evidence of at least 65 species—\nmostly mammals, but also some birds— that vocalize during social play.\nSome, unsurprisingly, are our closest relatives.\nBy recording and analyzing the sounds primates make\nwhile playing and being tickled,\nresearchers grew more convinced that the ancient ancestor of all great apes\ndid something like laughter.\nAnd, because other apes make laughter-like sounds during rough-and-tumble play,\nthey think laughter may have originally developed to clearly signal\nfriendly, non-aggressive intent.\nBut of course, humans don’t just laugh when we’re wrestling,\nbut also when we’re amused, and even surprised, confused, or nervous.\nSome scientists think laughter took on expanded functions\nafter humans split from other great apes\nand developed large social groups and more complex language abilities.\nThey hypothesize that laughter gradually became something we could use\nnot just during play but within speech to convey subtle meanings\nand a range of contexts to show our emotions.\nThis is thought to be one of the reasons that laughter is contagious:\nit’s like an invitation to share in someone’s emotional state.\nJust hearing clips of laughter can activate key regions in your brain,\ntriggering you to smile or laugh yourself.\nAnd, when participants in one study watched a funny video,\nthey laughed significantly longer and more often\nwhen another person was present—\neven though they reported feeling the same level of amusement.\nHuman laughter is also generally louder\nthan the play vocalizations of most animals.\nSome scientists speculate that this is because our laughter functions\nnot only as a signal between individuals, but a broadcast to everyone around.\nStudies found that observers across the world and as young as 5 months old\ncould reliably tell the difference between close friends and acquaintances\njust from brief clips of them laughing.\nSimilarly, we can tell whether a laugh is real or fake based just on the sound.\nFake, or volitional, laughter is produced\nin entirely different networks in the brain,\nrelying on speech-like pathways.\nMeanwhile, spontaneous laughter arises from older networks\nthat other animals also use for their vocalizations.\nAnd laughter is not just socially important;\nit’s also thought to be good for us.\nWhen we laugh, our brains release feel-good neurotransmitters\nlike endorphins,\nand decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol.\nSome research even suggests that people who laugh more\ncan cope with stress more effectively and have better cardiovascular health.\nLaughter is a universal human behavior.\nBabies can laugh before they can speak.\nWhether it's the best medicine depends on your ailment.\nBut as something that makes life more tolerable,\nstrengthens bonds, and potentially improves aspects of your health,\nyou can’t go wrong with a good laugh.\nUnless you have a broken rib or something.\nThen it’s no laughing matter.\nCertainly nothing to crack up about.","created":"2023-12-31

I think it's a Scarlet Tanager,\" Alex replied.\n\nMia nodded. \"You're right.

Alex was happy to find someone who shared his interest.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Alex and Mia met at the park almost every morning. They became good friends, exploring different parts of the park together and discovering new birds. They even started a small bird-watching club, inviting others to join them.\n\nOne day, as they sat on a bench watching a group of ducks on the lake, Alex turned to Mia and said, \"I'm really glad we met. Bird watching is so much more fun with a friend.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Mia agreed. \"It's amazing how birds brought us together.\"\n\nAs they continued to talk, a man approached them. He was holding a map and looking lost. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I heard there's a rare bird around here. Can you help me find it?\"\n\nAlex and Mia exchanged curious glances, intrigued by the new stranger. \"Sure,\" Alex said, standing up. \"We're happy to help.\"\n\nAs the three of them set off to find the rare bird, Alex and Mia wondered what other surprises and new friends their bird-watching adventures might bring.\n\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- Quiet (เงียบสงบ)\n- Town (เมือง)\n- Park (สวนสาธารณะ)\n- Trees (ต้นไม้)\n- Lake (ทะเลสาบ)\n- Morning (ตอนเช้า)\n- Walk (เดิน)\n- Jog (วิ่งจ็อกกิ้ง)\n- Relax (ผ่อนคลาย)\n- Strangers (คนแปลกหน้า)\n- Bird watching (การดูนก)\n- Binoculars (กล้องส่องทางไกล)\n- Rare (หายาก)\n- Feathers (ขน)\n- Excited (ตื่นเต้น)\n- Photo (รูปถ่าย)\n- Thrilled (ตื่นเต้นมาก)\n- Beautiful (สวย)\n- Scarlet Tanager (นกสีแดง)\n- Sharing (การแบ่งปัน)\n- Stories (เรื่องราว)\n- Tips (เคล็ดลับ)\n- Spots (สถานที่)\n- Exploring (การสำรวจ)\n- Discovering (การค้นพบ)\n- Club (ชมรม)\n- Inviting (เชิญ)\n- Ducks (เป็ด)\n- Adventures (การผจญภัย)\n- Friendship (มิตรภาพ)\n- Curious (อยากรู้อยากเห็น)\n- Intrigued (สนใจ)\n- Surprises (สิ่งที่น่าประหลาดใจ)","created":"2024-07-28 12:23:07.699Z","creatorId":"","id":"zjakt15wyd8y7fb","imageUrl":"en-birdwatching.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Bird Watchers","updated":"2024-07-28 12:23:07.699Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/birthday-paradox.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"It might seem surprising that two students in a class of just 30 can share a birthday. Our intuition tells us that with 365 possible birthdays (ignoring leap years for simplicity), the chance of any two people having the same birthday must be low.\n\nHere's the trick: The question isn't about you sharing a birthday with someone specifically, but about any two people in the class having the same birthday.\n\nImagine comparing birthdays one by one. The first person can have any birthday, so the chance is high (365 out of 365). The second person only needs to match the first person's birthday, which seems unlikely (1 out of 365). But that's just considering two people.\n\nWith 30 students, there are many more comparisons to make. We're not just checking you against everyone else, but every student compared to every other student (except for themselves, to avoid counting pairs twice). This significantly increases the chance of finding a matching pair.\n\nThis concept is called the birthday paradox. Even though the probability of any two specific people sharing a birthday is low, the probability of at least two people out of 30 sharing a birthday is surprisingly high - around 70%.\n\nThe more people you add to a group, the faster this probability increases. By 70 people, there's a nearly 100% chance of a birthday match!\n\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/","created":"2024-03-07 07:02:43.681Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"4zl3wkodt4kb5ss","imageUrl":"apps/assets/birthdays.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"The Birthday Paradox","updated":"2024-03-07 07:11:11.179Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Have you ever wondered about the likelihood of two people sharing the same birthday in a small group? It's a common intuition puzzle known as the \"birthday problem,\" and the answer is more surprising than you might expect. In a group of just 23 people, there's a 50.73% chance that two individuals will have the same birthday. This seems counterintuitive, considering there are 365 days in a year, so how can such a small group yield a probability higher than 50%?\r\n\r\n**Combinatorics: The Mathematical Approach**\r\n\r\nThe solution lies in the field of combinatorics, which examines the probabilities of different combinations. Instead of calculating the odds of a match directly, which is complex due to the numerous possible pairings, it's simpler to determine the probability that everyone has different birthdays and subtract it from 100%. For instance, if Person A has a birthday on one day, Person B has 364 other days to have a different birthday, giving a 99.7% chance of differing birthdays for any pair.\r\n\r\n**Growing Combinations and Our Non-Linear Intuition**\r\n\r\nAs more people are added to the group, the number of potential pairings increases rapidly. A group of five has ten possible pairs, ten people have 45 pairs, and 23 people have a staggering 253 pairs. This quadratic growth in combinations is what leads to the high probability of a shared birthday in relatively small groups. Our brains, however, struggle with grasping non-linear functions, making the birthday problem a fascinating example of how our intuition can be misleading.\r\n\r\n**Implications of the Birthday Problem**\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the birthday problem sheds light on the nature of probability and how seemingly improbable events, like winning the lottery twice, may not be as rare as they appear. It's a reminder that coincidences might not be coincidental after all, and that mathematics often reveals the unexpected truths behind our everyday experiences.\r\n\r\n","created":"2024-03-21 01:38:23.495Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"ztesnud7xvjozzq","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/youtube.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["NON-FICTION","B1"],"title":"The Birthday Paradox Explained","updated":"2024-08-01 09:07:03.535Z","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtT_cgMzHx8","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/busy-squirrel.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"A squirrel named Sam lived in a big tree.

Yet, science has its boundaries.\n\nMetaphysical questions about the fundamental nature of reality, the meaning of life, or the existence of an afterlife lie beyond the scientific realm.

He went closer and found a small golden snake. The snake had beautiful, glowing scales, and its eyes sparkled like stars.\n\nPong was not scared. He had always been kind to animals. He gently picked up the golden snake and said, “Don’t be afraid. I will not hurt you.”\n\nThe snake looked at Pong and spoke in a soft voice. “Thank you for your kindness. I am not an ordinary snake. I am a magical snake, and I can grant you one wish. What do you wish for?”\n\nPong thought for a moment. He did not wish for money or power. Instead, he said, “I wish for my village to always have enough food and water. I want everyone to be happy.”\n\nThe golden snake smiled. “You have a kind heart, Pong. Your wish will come true.”\n\nThe snake slowly disappeared, leaving behind a small golden scale. Pong took the scale and kept it with him as a reminder of the magical snake.\n\nFrom that day on, the village always had enough food, and the people were happy. Pong became a hero in the village, not because of riches, but because of his kindness and selfless wish.\n\nAnd so, Pong lived a happy life, always remembering the day he met the golden snake.\n\nThe End.\n\n### Vocabulary\n\n- village (หมู่บ้าน)\n- jungle (ป่า)\n- boy (เด็กผู้ชาย)\n- simple (เรียบง่าย)\n- explore (สำรวจ)\n- trees (ต้นไม้)\n- rocks (ก้อนหิน)\n- sounds (เสียง)\n- nature (ธรรมชาติ)\n- sunny (แดดออก)\n- afternoon (ตอนบ่าย)\n- stream (ลำธาร)\n- shiny (เป็นประกาย)\n- grass (หญ้า)\n- snake (งู)\n- glowing (ส่องแสง)\n- scales (เกล็ด)\n- stars (ดวงดาว)\n- afraid (กลัว)\n- animals (สัตว์)\n- kind (ใจดี)\n- wish (คำขอ)\n- money (เงิน)\n- power (อำนาจ)\n- food (อาหาร)\n- water (น้ำ)\n- happy (มีความสุข)\n- hero (วีรบุรุษ)\n- heart (หัวใจ)\n- reminder (สิ่งเตือนใจ)","created":"2024-08-15 07:30:09.954Z","creatorId":"","id":"dhxdltarkxribf2","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-golden-snake.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Golden Snake","updated":"2024-08-15 07:33:22.011Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/Haunted-Library-01.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"### Chapter 1: The Strange Occurrence\n\nEmily loved visiting the local library. It was quiet, and the smell of old books made her feel at home. One sunny afternoon, she went there to find a book for her school project. She waved at Ms. Carter, the librarian, who was organizing books on a shelf.\n\n\"Hi, Ms. Carter!\" Emily said with a smile.\n\n\"Hello, Emily! What are you looking for today?\" Ms. Carter asked.\n\n\"I need a book about the history of our town,\" Emily replied.\n\nMs. Carter pointed to a section at the back of the library. \"You can find them over there.\"\n\nEmily walked to the back of the library, her footsteps echoing on the wooden floor. She found a row of old books with dusty covers. As she reached for one of the books, she heard a strange noise. It sounded like whispering, but there was no one around.\n\n\"Hello? Is anyone there?\" Emily called out. There was no answer.\n\nSuddenly, a book fell off the shelf and landed at her feet. Emily picked it up, her heart pounding. She put it back on the shelf and quickly chose a different book. As she turned to leave, she heard another noise, like the sound of pages turning.\n\nEmily looked around nervously. \"This place is really old,\" she thought. \"Maybe it's just the wind.\"\n\nWhen she returned to the front of the library, she told Ms. Carter about the strange noises and the falling book.\n\nMs. Carter smiled. \"Oh, it's probably just a draft. This building is old and has many creaky spots. Don't worry about it.\"\n\nEmily nodded, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was not right. As she walked home, she kept thinking about the strange noises. She decided she would come back to the library the next day to see if she could find out what was really happening.\n\nThat night, Emily couldn't sleep.

After a few minutes, she heard a soft whisper again. Her heart raced, but she forced herself to stay calm.\n\nShe noticed a draft coming from behind a bookshelf. \"That's strange,\" she thought. She pushed the bookshelf slightly and felt a cool breeze. \"There must be a hidden room back there,\" she whispered to herself.\n\nDetermined to find out more, Emily made a plan.

Inside, she found a dark, dusty room filled with old books and papers. The room smelled musty, like it hadn't been opened in years.\n\nEmily's heart raced with excitement. She shone her flashlight around the room, her eyes scanning the shelves. In the corner, she saw an old diary. She picked it up and carefully opened it. The pages were yellowed with age, and the handwriting was neat and small.\n\nThe diary belonged to a girl named Alice, who had lived in the town many years ago.

She read each entry carefully, feeling like she was stepping into the past. Alice wrote about her daily life in the town, her friends, and her love for the library. But most importantly, she wrote about a secret treasure hidden somewhere in the library.\n\nOne entry caught Emily's attention:\n\n\"July 15, 1923: Today, I hid the last clue in the library. I hope someone worthy finds the treasure. It holds the key to our town's true history. I must keep it safe from those who would misuse it.\"\n\nEmily's heart raced. A hidden treasure in the library? She couldn't believe it. She read on, hoping to find more clues about the treasure’s location. Each entry seemed to provide pieces of a puzzle.\n\nThe next day, Emily rushed to school and told her friends, Lily and Jake, about her discovery. They were excited and eager to help.\n\n\"Are you sure it’s safe?\" Lily asked, looking a bit worried.\n\n\"It’ll be an adventure,\" Jake said, grinning. \"I’m in!\"\n\nAfter school, the three friends met at the library. Emily showed them the hidden room and Alice’s diary. They read through the entries together, searching for clues.\n\n\"Look at this,\" Jake said, pointing to one entry. \"Alice wrote about a painting in the library that holds a secret.\"\n\nThey quickly went to the art section of the library and found the painting Alice described. It was an old painting of the town. Emily felt along the edges of the frame and found a loose corner. She gently pried it open, revealing a small piece of paper hidden inside.\n\nThe paper had a drawing of the library with an “X” marking a spot in the basement.\n\n\"That's it!\" Emily exclaimed. \"The treasure must be in the basement.\"\n\nMs. Carter, who had been watching them from a distance, approached. \"What are you kids up to?\" she asked with a curious smile.\n\nEmily decided to trust her. \"Ms. Carter, we found an old diary that talks about a hidden treasure in the library. We think it’s in the basement.\"\n\nMs. Carter's eyes widened. \"A hidden treasure? Well, I’ve always known this place held secrets. Let’s find out together.\"\n\nWith Ms. Carter's help, they went down to the basement. It was dark and a bit creepy, but they were all too excited to be scared. They followed the map and finally reached a corner marked with an “X”. Behind a loose brick, they found a small chest.\n\nEmily opened the chest carefully. Inside were old documents and artifacts that told the true history of the town. It was an incredible discovery.\n\nMs. Carter smiled warmly. \"You kids have done something amazing.

Finally, Lily had a breakthrough. \"I think I’ve got it!\" she exclaimed. \"Each number corresponds to a letter in the alphabet. For example, 1 is A, 2 is B, and so on.\"\n\nThey quickly wrote down the decoded message. It read:\n\n\"Look behind the old clock.\"\n\nEmily's eyes widened. \"The old clock! It’s in the reading room.\"\n\nThey rushed to the reading room where a large, antique clock stood against the wall. The clock was tall and wooden, with intricate carvings. Emily reached behind it and found a small, hidden compartment. Inside was another piece of paper with more numbers and letters.\n\n\"There's another code,\" Jake said, holding up the paper.\n\nThey decoded the second message, which led them to another part of the library. This process continued as they followed each clue, each one leading to another hidden message.

Emily looked around and noticed a loose floorboard. She pried it open and found a small box inside.\n\nThey opened the box and found an old map and a key. The map showed the layout of the library, with a mark on the basement. The key was old and rusty, clearly meant for something important.\n\n\"This must be it,\" Emily said. \"The final piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nMs. Carter joined them, smiling warmly. \"You’ve done a great job. Let’s see where this map and key lead us.\"\n\nTogether, they went back to the basement. Following the map, they reached a corner that looked different from the rest. Emily used the key to unlock a small, hidden door. Behind it, they found a chest similar to the first one but bigger and more ornate.\n\nInside were more documents and artifacts, but this time they included letters and journals from the town’s founders, detailing their lives and struggles. They found old photographs, tools, and even some old coins.\n\nMs. Carter looked at the items with awe. \"These are priceless. They tell the real story of our town. You kids have uncovered something truly special.\"\n\nEmily felt a deep sense of accomplishment.

The library was more than just a place for books; it was a treasure trove of history. They learned about the town's founders, their struggles, and their dreams. The story of their town was richer and more interesting than they had ever imagined.\n\nOne evening, Emily decided to stay late at the library to read more of Alice’s diary. The library was quiet and empty, with only the sound of the old clock ticking in the background. As she read, she came across an entry that sent chills down her spine.\n\n\"August 5, 1923: I saw a ghostly figure near the old clock. It looked like it was trying to tell me something. I am not afraid, but I must understand what it wants.\"\n\nEmily looked up at the old clock. She had never believed in ghosts, but Alice's words made her curious. She decided to investigate. She walked to the clock, shining her flashlight around. Suddenly, she felt a cold breeze and saw a faint, ghostly figure. It looked like a young girl, just like Alice had described.\n\n\"Hello?\" Emily called out, her voice trembling. \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe ghostly figure moved slowly, pointing towards the hidden room. Emily followed it, her heart pounding. The figure led her to the hidden room and then disappeared. Emily stood there, trying to calm herself.\n\nShe decided to look around the hidden room again. This time, she found a hidden drawer in the desk that she hadn't noticed before. Inside the drawer was another diary, even older than Alice’s. It belonged to one of the town’s founders, a woman named Clara.\n\nEmily opened Clara’s diary and began to read. Clara wrote about her life, her family, and the founding of the town. But she also wrote about a terrible event that had been forgotten over the years—a fire that had destroyed many homes and lives. Clara had hidden the town’s most valuable documents to protect them from the fire.\n\nAs Emily read, she realized that the ghostly figure must have been trying to tell her about this forgotten part of the town’s history. The diary mentioned a secret compartment in the library where these documents were hidden. Emily felt a surge of excitement. She had to find these documents and bring them to light.\n\nThe next day, Emily gathered her friends and Ms. Carter. She told them about the ghostly figure and Clara’s diary. Together, they searched the library for the secret compartment. After hours of searching, they finally found it behind an old bookshelf.\n\nInside the compartment, they found a bundle of documents wrapped in cloth. The documents were fragile but readable. They detailed the town’s founding, the fire, and the efforts to rebuild. There were letters, maps, and even some photographs.\n\nMs. Carter looked at the documents with tears in her eyes. \"These are amazing. They tell the true story of our town. We must preserve them and share them with everyone.\"\n\nEmily felt a deep sense of accomplishment.

They spent several days organizing and cataloging the documents they had found. Each new discovery brought more excitement and a deeper understanding of their town’s past.\n\nOne afternoon, while Emily was reading through a particularly old and worn letter, she found a reference to a hidden treasure that had been buried by the town’s founders. The letter described the treasure as a collection of gold coins and valuable artifacts meant to help the town in times of need. Emily’s heart raced as she realized they might be on the brink of finding something truly extraordinary.\n\n\"Look at this,\" Emily said, showing the letter to Lily and Jake. \"It talks about a hidden treasure buried by the founders. We need to find it.\"\n\nJake’s eyes widened. \"A real treasure? This is incredible!\"\n\nLily nodded. \"We have to figure out where it’s buried. Does the letter give any clues?\"\n\nEmily scanned the letter again. \"It says the treasure is buried where the four winds meet and the old oak stands tall.\"\n\nThey decided to ask Ms. Carter for help. She thought for a moment and then smiled. \"I think I know where that is. There’s an old oak tree in the park at the center of town. It’s one of the oldest trees here.\"\n\nExcited, the group made their way to the park. The old oak tree stood tall and majestic, its branches stretching out like welcoming arms. They searched around the base of the tree, looking for any signs of where the treasure might be buried.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Jake shouted, \"I found something!\" He pointed to a spot where the ground looked different. They began to dig carefully, not wanting to damage anything. After a short while, they hit something hard. It was a small, metal box, covered in dirt and rust.\n\nEmily's hands trembled as she opened the box. Inside, they found a collection of gold coins, old jewelry, and valuable artifacts. There was also a letter from the town’s founders, explaining that the treasure was meant to support the town during hard times and to remind future generations of their heritage.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" Lily said, her voice full of awe. \"We’ve found a real treasure.\"\n\nMs. Carter smiled proudly. \"You kids have done something incredible.

Like all leprechauns, Finn had a pot of gold hidden at the end of a rainbow. He loved to count his shiny coins and keep them all to himself. But one day, something changed.\n\nAs Finn was walking through the village, he saw children playing in the fields, laughing and running under the bright sun. But then, he noticed something that made his heart feel heavy—some of the children didn’t have shoes, and others wore old, torn clothes.\n\nFinn scratched his head under his little green hat. “Why do they look so sad?” he wondered. He had always kept his gold because he thought it made him happy, but seeing those children made him feel different. \n\n“I have all this gold, and they have so little,” Finn whispered. “Maybe I should share it.”\n\nThe very next day, Finn did something no leprechaun had ever done before. He filled a large sack with gold coins, slung it over his shoulder, and skipped down the hill to the village. When he arrived, the children looked at him in surprise.\n\n“Hello there!” Finn called with a big grin. “I’ve brought you a gift. Take as much gold as you need!”\n\nThe children’s eyes grew wide with joy as Finn handed out shiny coins. With the gold, they were able to buy new shoes, warm clothes, and plenty of delicious food for their families. The village was filled with laughter and happiness, and Finn’s heart felt lighter than ever before.\n\nFrom that day on, Finn became known as the kindest leprechaun in all of Ireland. He realized that sharing his gold made him far happier than keeping it all to himself. And though his pot of gold became smaller, his heart grew much, much bigger.\n\nAnd so, Finn lived happily ever after, sharing his gold and spreading joy wherever he went.\n\nThe end.","created":"2024-09-20 14:30:43.307Z","creatorId":"","id":"9v8wet98el9oczm","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-leprachaun-share.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Leprechaun's Gift","updated":"2024-09-20 14:30:51.618Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/logic-limits.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"While argumentation can be a tool for changing minds, it's important to acknowledge that it's not always completely effective. People are often guided by feelings and pre-existing beliefs.  Our tendency for confirmation bias means we filter information to favor what we already think, while emotional attachments and social identities can make it difficult to let go of deeply held positions. These factors can make purely logical arguments feel unsatisfying and even threatening to someone on the opposite side of an issue.\r\n\r\nSo, what can make argumentation more effective?  Finding common ground is an excellent first step.  Identify shared values or beliefs as a starting point for building trust and openness to your perspective. It's also crucial to recognize the role of emotions in shaping beliefs.  Acknowledging the other person's feelings, whether it's fear, pride, or a sense of community tied to their stance, can soften the conversation. Storytelling and relatable examples often resonate more deeply than pure abstract logic, making your argument easier to understand and connect with.\r\n\r\nInstead of focusing solely on winning, adopt a curious mindset. Ask open-ended questions that help someone examine their own beliefs. Be respectful of their position, even when you deeply disagree. You might not win someone over entirely in one conversation, but you can plant seeds of doubt or a new perspective that may blossom over time.  Remember, changing minds is often slow work and requires a human touch beyond just presenting a logical case.","created":"2024-03-09 11:11:46.196Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"x024nfotj2222nn","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/brain.jpeg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["NON-FICTION","B1"],"title":"The Limits of Logic: Why Arguments Don't Always Sway People","updated":"2024-08-01 09:07:16.901Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/small-person-cook.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Long **ago**, there was a small **person** named Ben.

He wasn’t afraid of the dark, thunder didn’t make him jump, and he even liked the spooky ghost stories his friends told at sleepovers. But recently, something had started to bother him. Every night, as he lay in bed, a strange scratching sound came from beneath him.\n\nAt first, Luca thought it was just his imagination. After all, who hears scratching from under their bed, right? But the sound kept coming back—every single night. It was soft, but persistent. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Luca asked his parents if there were mice in the house. They smiled and said it was probably just the house settling. But Luca wasn’t so sure.\n\nOne night, the scratching became louder than usual. Luca couldn’t sleep at all. He tossed and turned, but the sound seemed to echo in his ears. Finally, after hours of lying awake, Luca decided he had to know what was causing it.\n\nHe grabbed a flashlight from his bedside table and slowly leaned over the edge of the bed. He hesitated for a moment, his heart beating faster. What if it really was something scary? But Luca shook the thought away. He was brave, after all.\n\nWith a deep breath, he clicked on the flashlight and peeked under the bed.\n\nWhat he saw made his eyes go wide with surprise.\n\nThere, hiding in the shadows, was a tiny creature. It had big, round eyes that shimmered in the flashlight’s beam and soft, green fur that covered its small body. The creature was holding a little stick, which it had been using to scratch the floor. But instead of looking scary, the creature looked just as frightened as Luca felt.\n\n“Who… who are you?” Luca asked, his voice trembling just a little.\n\nThe creature blinked its large eyes and whispered in a small, shaky voice, “My name is Grumple. I’m lost. I come from the tunnels under your house. I’ve been trying to find my way back home, but I got stuck here under your bed.”\n\nLuca’s fear melted away and was replaced by curiosity. “Tunnels under my house? What tunnels?” he asked.\n\nGrumple looked embarrassed and shuffled his furry feet. “There are magical tunnels that run all through the town. Only creatures like me can see them. I was exploring, but I got lost, and now I can’t find my way back.”\n\nLuca felt sorry for Grumple. He knew what it felt like to be lost. “Don’t worry,” he said, offering a kind smile. “I’ll help you find your home.”\n\nGrumple’s eyes lit up with hope. “You will? Thank you! But… you’ll have to come with me into the tunnels.”\n\nLuca’s heart skipped a beat. He had never heard of magical tunnels under his house, but he was too curious to say no. Grabbing a sweater and a small backpack, he followed Grumple as they crawled under the bed. There, to Luca’s amazement, was a tiny door hidden in the shadows. Grumple pushed it open, and beyond it lay a winding, glowing tunnel. Soft lights twinkled along the walls, and strange, melodic sounds floated through the air—like the chiming of bells or the hum of distant music.\n\nLuca stepped inside, his eyes wide with wonder. “This is incredible!” he whispered.\n\nGrumple nodded, leading the way deeper into the tunnel. As they walked, the sounds grew louder, guiding them through twists and turns. They passed by shimmering pools of water, glowing mushrooms, and strange, tiny creatures who peeked at them from the shadows.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, they reached a large chamber where the sounds were the loudest. In the center of the room stood a tall, ancient tree, its branches glowing with soft blue light. At the base of the tree, a group of creatures that looked just like Grumple sat in a circle, humming softly.\n\nGrumple rushed forward. “Mom! Dad! I’m back!” he cried.\n\nThe creatures turned and gasped in delight. “Grumple! We’ve been so worried!” they said, hugging him tightly. Grumple’s parents thanked Luca over and over, saying how grateful they were that he had helped their son find his way home.\n\nBefore Luca left, Grumple promised to visit him again soon—but next time, he would knock on the door, instead of scratching from under the bed.\n\nAs Luca crawled back through the tunnel and returned to his bedroom, he felt a deep sense of wonder. There was a whole world beneath his house that no one knew about, and now he had a new friend who lived in that world.\n\nFrom that night on, Luca no longer feared the scratching sound. Instead, he smiled whenever he heard it, knowing that it was just Grumple, waiting for another adventure.\n\n### Vocabulary List:\n- Brave (กล้าหาญ)\n- Friends (เพื่อน)\n- Afraid (กลัว)\n- Thunder (ฟ้าร้อง)\n- Ghost stories (เรื่องผี)\n- Bother (รบกวน)\n- Scratching (เสียงข่วน)\n- Imagination (จินตนาการ)\n- Persistent (ต่อเนื่อง)\n- Flashlight (ไฟฉาย)\n- Hesitate (ลังเล)\n- Surprise (ประหลาดใจ)\n- Shadows (เงา)\n- Creature (สิ่งมีชีวิต)\n- Tunnels (อุโมงค์)\n- Embarrassed (อาย)\n- Explore (สำรวจ)\n- Curiosity (ความอยากรู้)\n- Shimmer (เปล่งประกาย)\n- Magical (มหัศจรรย์)\n- Mushrooms (เห็ด)\n- Glowing (เรืองแสง)\n- Chamber (ห้องใหญ่)\n- Promise (สัญญา)\n- Adventure (การผจญภัย)","created":"2024-08-18 05:37:13.627Z","creatorId":"","id":"8mi7pmect0jqf3p","imageUrl":"en-grumple.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Monster Under the Bed","updated":"2024-08-18 05:37:13.627Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Imagine you're on a game show where you have a chance to win a brand-new car. The car is hidden behind one of three doors, with the other two concealing goats. After you make your initial choice, the host, who knows what's behind each door, reveals a goat behind one of the other two doors and offers you a chance to switch your choice. Should you do it? Does it even make a difference?\r\n\r\nContrary to what may seem logical, changing your choice actually doubles your odds of winning the car. This is known as the Monty Hall Problem. Initially, you might correctly assume that you have a one in three chance of choosing the correct door. However, it would be incorrect to assume that when one door is removed, each of the remaining doors now holds a 50/50 chance of having the car.\r\n\r\nTo understand why, consider a deck of cards. If you pick a card at random, it has a 1 in 52 chance of being the Ace of Spades. But if all the other cards except one are flipped over, none of which are the Ace of Spades, which card seems more likely to be the Ace of Spades? The one you chose randomly, or the one left turned down? Your card remains at a chance of 1 in 52, while the card left turned down now has a 51 out of 52 probability of being the Ace of Spades.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to the three doors. When the host removes a door, they do so knowingly, revealing a goat. The only two scenarios that exist are: A) You chose the correct door initially, and the host shows you a wrong choice (in which case staying wins), or B) You picked the wrong door, and the host shows you the other incorrect answer (in which case switching wins). Scenario 'A' will happen one-third of the time (when you choose the winning door), and 'B' will happen two-thirds of the time (when you pick a losing door). Therefore, switching your door wins two out of three times.\r\n\r\nThis paradox has perplexed many people, including scientists and mathematicians, because our intuition tells us that switching should have no consequence. However, formal calculations and computer simulations show that switching your door indeed increases the probability of winning. So, do you still trust your gut feeling?","created":"2024-03-21 01:44:31.035Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"5sgggvdwngtzw98","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/youtube.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"The Monty Hall Problem - A Counter-Intuitive Probability Puzzle","updated":"2024-08-01 09:06:46.346Z","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vRUxbzJZ9Y","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/naughty-kitten.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Lucy had a kitten named Mittens.

This can lead us to overlook the possibility of multiple contributing factors or the role of chance, instead favoring a single, identifiable cause, even if it's inaccurate. For example, attempting to pinpoint a single \"culprit\" for an economic recession might ignore the complex interplay of various economic, social, and political factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several possible evolutionary explanations for why we experience the need for agents, attributing events to specific causes rather than accepting randomness. These reasons are rooted in our ancestral past and the survival benefits associated with identifying agents:\r\n\r\n1. Pattern Recognition and Prediction: Early humans lived in a world filled with potential dangers. Identifying \"agents\" behind events, even if sometimes inaccurate, could have helped them predict and avoid future threats. For instance, attributing a rustling sound in the bushes to a predator, even if it was the wind, might have prompted them to move to safety, potentially increasing their chances of survival.\r\n\r\n2. Sense of Control: Assigning agency to events, even when incorrect, could have provided a sense of control in an uncertain environment. This could have been psychologically beneficial, fostering a feeling of agency and the ability to potentially influence outcomes, even if the influence was limited.\r\n\r\n3. Social Navigation and Cooperation: Recognizing agents within social groups might have been crucial for understanding intentions and navigating social interactions effectively. By attributing actions and emotions to others, early humans could have better predicted their behavior and formed cooperative relationships, enhancing their chances of survival and reproduction.\r\n\r\n4. Causal Learning: While attributing agents to random events can lead to errors in judgment, it could have also served as a starting point for causal learning. By constantly seeking explanations and agents behind events, even if inaccurate at times, humans may have gradually developed a better understanding of cause-and-effect relationships, ultimately leading to improved decision-making and adaptation in their environment.","created":"2024-03-06 02:02:02.176Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"fe2prh8qo9chplc","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/thinking.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["NON-FICTION","B1"],"title":"The Need for Agents","updated":"2024-08-01 09:07:46.066Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"new-kittens-en.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Lucy was excited when she heard the news.

She spent most of her time at school or working at the local diner. Life was predictable—until the day Daniel arrived.\n\nDaniel was different. He had deep blue eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets and a smile that felt like it came from somewhere far away. He moved into the old house at the end of Maple Street, the one with the broken shutters and the overgrown garden. People said it was haunted, but Daniel didn’t seem to care.\n\nOne afternoon, Lily saw him sitting alone at the riverbank, staring at the sky. She walked over and asked, \"Why do you always sit here by yourself?\"\n\nDaniel turned his eyes to her and smiled softly. \"I like watching the stars, even during the day. They remind me of… home.\"\n\nLily found that curious, but she didn't ask more. From that day on, they became inseparable. They met by the river every afternoon and talked for hours about everything and nothing—the stars, their dreams, and places Lily had never even heard of. Daniel spoke of distant lands and strange creatures as if he had seen them himself.\n\nSlowly, Lily began to feel something deeper for Daniel. His presence made her heart beat faster, and she often found herself lost in his gaze. One evening, under a sky full of stars, she asked, \"Daniel, why did you come here?\"\n\nHe paused for a long time, looking at the stars, then replied, \"I’m just passing through. I can’t stay here for long.\"\n\nLily felt a pang in her chest. \"Why not?\" she whispered.\n\nDaniel smiled, but there was sadness in his eyes. \"Because I don’t belong here.\"\n\nLily didn’t understand what he meant, but she didn’t ask. She simply leaned closer to him, hoping he could feel how much she cared. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, and for a moment, they sat quietly under the stars.\n\nThe next morning, Lily went to the river, but Daniel was gone. She waited for hours, but he never appeared. She asked everyone in town, but no one had seen him. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.\n\nThen, one day, she found a small note under a smooth stone where they used to sit. It read: \"Thank you, Lily, for showing me kindness. I wish I could stay, but my time here was short. Look up at the stars, and think of me. — Daniel.\"\n\nLily felt tears fill her eyes. She looked up at the night sky, now knowing why he loved the stars so much.

Le Guin. \r\n\r\nThe story begins with a vivid description of the city of Omelas during the Festival of Summer. Omelas is portrayed as a place of joy, prosperity, and happiness, where people live harmoniously without the burdens of war, disease, or death. The citizens are not simple-minded; they are complex individuals who understand the nuances of life.\r\n\r\nHowever, the seemingly perfect existence in Omelas comes with a horrifying secret. The city's happiness and prosperity are contingent upon the suffering of a single child, who is kept in abject conditions in a basement. Every citizen of Omelas knows about this child's existence and the role it plays in their happiness.\r\n\r\nThe title of the story refers to the individuals who, after learning about the child, choose to walk away from Omelas, unable to accept the moral compromise. They leave the comfort and joy of Omelas, facing an uncertain and possibly grim future.\r\n\r\nThis story poses a significant ethical question: Is it acceptable for a society to thrive and prosper at the expense of a single individual's suffering? It challenges readers to reflect on the complexities of happiness, the cost of perfection, and the moral choices we make. It's a powerful tool for exploring philosophical concepts such as utilitarianism and the social contract. \r\n\r\nConsider how various schools of thought might interpret the moral dilemma:\r\n\r\n1. **Utilitarianism**: Utilitarians, like John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, argue that actions are right insofar as they maximize social utility⁷. In the context of the story, the happiness of the entire city of Omelas is prioritized over the suffering of one child⁷. The citizens who stay in Omelas, knowing the child's misery is the cost of their happiness, could be seen as adhering to utilitarian principles⁷.\r\n\r\n2. **Deontology**: Deontologists, such as Immanuel Kant, argue that some rules should be upheld at any cost⁷. From this perspective, the torturing of the child in Omelas would be seen as impermissible, regardless of the happiness it brings to the rest of the city⁷. The citizens who walk away from Omelas, unable to accept the moral compromise, could be seen as adhering to deontological ethics⁷.\r\n\r\n3. **Existentialism**: Existentialists might focus on the individual's struggle with the moral dilemma and the personal choice to either accept or reject the societal norms of Omelas. The ones who walk away from Omelas do so with a sense of purpose, seemingly knowing where they are going¹. This could be seen as an existential act of defining one's own path.\r\n\r\n4. **Virtue Ethics**: Virtue ethicists, like Aristotle, emphasize the role of one's character and the virtues that one's character embodies for determining ethical behavior. From this perspective, the moral dilemma in Omelas could be seen as a test of virtue. The decision to walk away from Omelas might be seen as an act of courage, a key virtue in Aristotelian ethics.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 1/13/2024","created":"2024-01-13 07:41:22.520Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"0ga0wqng4kcn6cv","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/walk-away.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["NON-FICTION","B1"],"title":"The Ones Who Walk Away","updated":"2024-08-01 09:08:02.761Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-pair-pear.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"In a sunny orchard, two pears hung side by side on the same branch.

This aspect of English focuses on the result of an action and how it connects to other events or periods, often showing a timeline or sequence of events. There are three main perfect tenses: **present perfect**, **past perfect**, and **future perfect**. Each of these tenses serves a distinct purpose in indicating the timing and completion of actions.\n\n### 1. **Present Perfect**\nThe present perfect tense is used to describe actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past or actions that began in the past and continue into the present. It is formed using the auxiliary verb \"have\" (or \"has\" for third-person singular) followed by the past participle of the main verb.\n\n- **Structure**: *have/has + past participle*\n  \n- **Example**: \"I have lived in Thailand for five years, and during that time, I have learned to speak Thai quite well.\"\n  \n  **Explanation**: In this sentence, the speaker emphasizes the ongoing result of an action (living in Thailand) that began in the past and is still relevant or continuing into the present. The speaker is connecting past experiences with their current ability to speak Thai, highlighting the completion of the action over time and its effect on the present.\n\nThe present perfect often focuses on the consequences or results of past actions as they relate to the present. This can include things like experiences (\"I have visited France\"), accomplishments (\"She has finished her degree\"), and continuing states (\"They have lived here since 2010\").\n\n### 2. **Past Perfect**\nThe past perfect tense is used to describe an action that was completed before another action in the past. This tense helps clarify the order of past events and is formed using the auxiliary verb \"had\" followed by the past participle of the main verb.\n\n- **Structure**: *had + past participle*\n  \n- **Example**: \"By the time I arrived at the party, everyone had already eaten and left.\"\n  \n  **Explanation**: The past perfect tense in this sentence shows that the actions of eating and leaving were completed before the speaker arrived at the party. The relationship between the two events is clear: the first action (eating and leaving) had already happened before the second event (the speaker's arrival). This creates a sequence, ensuring the listener understands the order in which the actions occurred.\n\nThe past perfect is particularly useful for establishing a timeline when recounting events in the past, showing that one event was completed before another.\n\n### 3. **Future Perfect**\nThe future perfect tense is used to describe an action that will be completed before a certain point in the future. This tense is formed using \"will have\" followed by the past participle of the main verb.\n\n- **Structure**: *will have + past participle*\n  \n- **Example**: \"By next Friday, I will have completed the entire project, so we can start the new phase without any delays.\"\n  \n  **Explanation**: The future perfect tense indicates that by a specific point in the future (next Friday), the speaker will have finished the project. The sentence connects the completion of the project to a future moment, demonstrating that one event will be finished before another can begin.\n\nThe future perfect helps to establish expectations about the order and timing of future actions, showing that a certain event will be completed before a future deadline or action.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe perfect tenses in English are essential for communicating the timing and sequence of events in relation to one another. Whether you’re discussing an ongoing result with the present perfect, clarifying past events with the past perfect, or projecting future completion with the future perfect, these tenses provide a way to clearly express the relationship between actions across time. Understanding how to use these tenses will help you more accurately convey your meaning in both spoken and written English.","created":"2024-08-18 06:17:38.942Z","creatorId":"","id":"97qpaivazuxej6r","imageUrl":"en-perfect-tenses.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","GRAMMAR"],"title":"The Perfect Tenses","updated":"2024-08-18 06:24:32.309Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/growth-mindset.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Try pre-reading this summary of the video and then try watching it without subtitles.\n\n## Speaker: Carol Dweck\nCarol Dweck is a psychologist who studies how people think and learn. She is interested in how people's beliefs about their abilities affect their motivation and performance.\n\n## Main idea: Growth mindset vs. fixed mindset\nCarol Dweck explains the difference between two mindsets: growth mindset and fixed mindset. A growth mindset is the belief that you can develop your abilities through effort, strategy, and feedback. A fixed mindset is the belief that your abilities are fixed and cannot change much.\n\n## Examples: How mindsets affect learning and behavior\nCarol Dweck gives some examples of how mindsets affect learning and behavior in different situations:\n\n- In school, some students love challenges and see them as opportunities to learn. They have a growth mindset. Other students avoid challenges and see them as threats to their self-esteem. They have a fixed mindset.\n- In the brain, some students show more activity when they make mistakes. They pay attention to the errors and try to correct them. They have a growth mindset. Other students show less activity when they make mistakes. They ignore the errors and try to forget them. They have a fixed mindset.\n- In life, some students praise wisely. They focus on the process of learning, such as effort, strategy, and improvement. They have a growth mindset. Other students praise unwisely. They focus on the outcome of learning, such as grades, scores, and awards. They have a fixed mindset.\n\n## Conclusion: The power of yet\nCarol Dweck concludes by saying that we can change our mindsets and help others change theirs. She suggests using the word \"yet\" to encourage a growth mindset. For example, instead of saying \"I can't do this\", we can say \"I can't do this yet\". She says that this simple word can give us more confidence, persistence, and resilience. She says that having a growth mindset is a basic human right for all children and adults. She says that living in a place filled with \"yet\" can help us achieve our dreams.\n","created":"2024-01-03 08:36:15.019Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"ri8e5hc5skqgmkl","imageUrl":"apps/assets/growth-mindset.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","B1","VIDEO"],"title":"The Power of Believing that you can Improve","updated":"2024-01-03 08:42:18.857Z","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/bilingualism.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Pre-read this summary of the video and then try watching the video without subtitles.\n\n# The Power of Bilingualism: A Mental Workout\n\nToday, we're going to dive into the fascinating world of bilingualism.

This process contributes to what scientists call the \"cognitive reserve,\" a term that refers to your brain's resilience to damage or disease.\n\n## The Dementia Delay\n\nIn a groundbreaking study led by Ellen Bialystok and her team, it was discovered that bilingual individuals develop dementia an average of 4 to 4.5 years later than those who speak only one language. This delay in the onset of dementia is a testament to the power of bilingualism and its positive effects on our brain health.\n\n## Benefits of Early and Late Bilingualism\n\nLearning languages at different ages activates different brain networks. A 2023 study found that early bilinguals, those who learn a second language in childhood, have stronger brain connectivity at rest. On the other hand, late bilinguals, those who learn a second language later in life, may experience greater cognitive benefits due to the challenge of modifying existing brain networks.\n\n## Emotional and Cultural Advantages\n\nBeyond cognitive benefits, bilingualism also offers emotional and cultural advantages. Bilingual individuals often have the ability to see different perspectives, reacting more emotionally in one language and more rationally in another. Moreover, learning new languages opens doors to understanding new cultures and communities, enriching your worldview and interpersonal relationships.\n\nSo, whether you're already bilingual or considering learning a new language, remember that each word you learn is not just vocabulary—it's a step towards a healthier, more connected, and more creative brain.","created":"2024-01-02 13:19:26.285Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"jbpmxdbj9ghknq5","imageUrl":"apps/assets/bilingual.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","SCIENCE","VIDEO"],"title":"The Power of Bilingualism: A Mental Workout","updated":"2024-01-02 13:28:04.390Z","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/nzHY-muy2Mw","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/rainy-day.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"The rain fell all day long.

Gossip spread quickly, and sometimes, harmless chatter turned into harmful rumors. Jessie, a high school junior, had always been part of the popular crowd. She enjoyed being in the know and often shared the latest news with her friends.\n\nOne day, Jessie overheard a conversation between two teachers about Mr. Brown, the new history teacher. They mentioned he had left his previous school abruptly. Curious and eager to share something juicy, Jessie told her friends that Mr. Brown had been fired for inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe rumor spread like wildfire. Soon, everyone was whispering about Mr. Brown. Students avoided him, and even some teachers seemed distant. Mr. Brown, noticing the change, looked sad and withdrawn.\n\nA week later, Jessie noticed that her best friend, Sarah, was avoiding her. When she finally confronted Sarah, she found out the truth. \"Jessie, that rumor you spread about Mr. Brown isn't true. He left his last school to take care of his sick mother,\" Sarah said angrily. \"Now everyone thinks he's a bad person because of you.\"\n\nJessie felt a wave of guilt wash over her. She hadn't meant to cause harm, but her careless words had damaged someone's reputation. Determined to make things right, she decided to talk to Mr. Brown.\n\nAfter school, Jessie found Mr. Brown in his classroom, grading papers. \"Mr. Brown, can I talk to you?\" she asked nervously.\n\nHe looked up, a tired expression on his face. \"Of course, Jessie. What is it?\"\n\nJessie took a deep breath. \"I'm really sorry. I started a rumor about you, and it wasn’t true. I overheard something and misunderstood. I’m so sorry for the trouble I caused.\"\n\nMr. Brown's eyes softened. \"I appreciate your honesty, Jessie. Rumors can be very hurtful. It takes courage to admit a mistake and apologize.\"\n\nFeeling a mix of relief and regret, Jessie left the classroom. The next day, she began telling everyone the truth, explaining that Mr. Brown had left his last job to care for his mother. Slowly, the whispers stopped, and people began treating Mr. Brown with respect again.\n\nJessie learned a valuable lesson about the power of words and the importance of thinking before speaking. From then on, she was more careful about what she shared, understanding that rumors could hurt real people with real lives.\n\nAs she walked home one afternoon, Jessie saw Mr. Brown leaving the school, a smile back on his face. She felt a sense of peace, knowing she had done the right thing.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- Gossip (ข่าวซุบซิบ)\n- Rumor (ข่าวลือ)\n- Popular (เป็นที่นิยม)\n- Overheard (ได้ยินมา)\n- Abruptly (อย่างกะทันหัน)\n- Inappropriate (ไม่เหมาะสม)\n- Behavior (พฤติกรรม)\n- Wildfire (ไฟป่า)\n- Whispering (การกระซิบ)\n- Avoiding (หลีกเลี่ยง)\n- Withdrawn (ถอยกลับ)\n- Guilty (รู้สึกผิด)\n- Confronted (เผชิญหน้า)\n- Reputation (ชื่อเสียง)\n- Determined (ตั้งใจ)\n- Nervously (อย่างประหม่า)\n- Appreciate (ขอบคุณ)\n- Honesty (ความซื่อสัตย์)\n- Courage (ความกล้าหาญ)\n- Mistake (ความผิดพลาด)\n- Respect (ความเคารพ)\n- Valuable (มีคุณค่า)\n- Lesson (บทเรียน)\n- Power (พลัง)\n- Hurtful (ทำให้เจ็บปวด)\n- Peace (ความสงบสุข)","created":"2024-07-28 12:34:41.273Z","creatorId":"","id":"1ijf75jlknchval","imageUrl":"en-the-rumor.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Rumor","updated":"2024-07-28 12:34:41.273Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"science-volcano.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Emma and Jack were excited about their science project.

Tom was an air traffic controller, a job that required focus, precision, and calm under pressure. He worked in a high tower, overlooking the runways where planes from all over the world landed and took off.\n\nTom loved his job. He felt like he was part of something big, something important. Every day, he helped keep the skies safe, guiding pilots through the crowded airspace over one of the busiest airports in the world. But lately, he had been feeling uneasy. There was something strange happening during his night shifts.\n\nOne evening, as Tom was settling into his routine, he noticed something odd on his radar. A blip appeared, moving slowly towards the airport. It wasn't a scheduled flight, and it wasn't responding to his calls. Tom frowned and tried again.\n\n\"Unidentified aircraft, this is O'Hare Tower. Please respond,\" he said into his headset. But there was no answer.\n\nTom watched as the blip continued to move closer. It seemed almost ghostly, flickering on the screen. Suddenly, it vanished. Tom blinked, wondering if he had imagined it. He looked around at his colleagues, but they were all busy with their own tasks.\n\nThe next night, it happened again. The same slow-moving blip appeared on the radar, ignored his calls, and then disappeared. Tom's curiosity grew. He started to feel a chill whenever he thought about it.\n\nOn the third night, he decided to investigate further. He finished his shift and waited until the control tower was quiet. Then, he walked down to the maintenance area, where he found an old technician named Frank. Frank had been working at the airport for decades and knew everything about it.\n\n\"Hey Frank,\" Tom said. \"Can I ask you something?\"\n\n\"Sure, kid. What's on your mind?\" Frank replied, looking up from his work.\n\n\"Have you ever seen a strange blip on the radar during the night shift? It appears out of nowhere and then just vanishes,\" Tom explained.\n\nFrank's face grew serious. He put down his tools and motioned for Tom to sit. \"I've seen it,\" he said quietly. \"It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's always during the night shift.\"\n\nTom leaned in, eager to hear more. \"What is it? Do you know where it comes from?\"\n\nFrank shook his head. \"No one knows for sure. Some say it's a ghost plane, a flight that disappeared years ago. Others think it's a glitch in the system. But there's one thing everyone agrees on: it's bad luck.\"\n\n\"Bad luck?\" Tom repeated, feeling a shiver run down his spine.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Frank said. \"Strange things happen when that blip shows up. Planes go off course, equipment malfunctions, even accidents. I've seen it all. My advice? Stay away from it. Don't try to make contact. Just let it be.\"\n\nTom left the maintenance area with a heavy heart. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. That night, as he walked to his car, he thought he saw a shadow moving behind him. He spun around, but there was nothing there. The wind howled through the empty parking lot, and Tom hurried to his car, locking the doors as soon as he got inside.\n\nAs he drove home, he couldn't stop thinking about the ghostly blip. What if it wasn't just a glitch? What if there was something more to it? Tom knew he had to find out, even if it meant risking his own safety. He would uncover the mystery of the ghost plane, no matter what it took.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- **air traffic controller** - a person who directs aircraft (ผู้ควบคุมการจราจรทางอากาศ)\n- **focus** - attention to a task (สมาธิ)\n- **precision** - exactness (ความแม่นยำ)\n- **calm** - serenity (ความสงบ)\n- **pressure** - stress (ความกดดัน)\n- **tower** - a tall structure (หอคอย)\n- **runway** - a strip where aircraft take off and land (ทางวิ่ง)\n- **radar** - a system for detecting objects (เรดาร์)\n- **blip** - a small dot on a radar screen (จุดบนหน้าจอเรดาร์)\n- **scheduled** - planned (กำหนดการ)\n- **responding** - answering (ตอบสนอง)\n- **ghostly** - like a ghost (เหมือนผี)\n- **flickering** - flashing (กระพริบ)\n- **colleagues** - co-workers (เพื่อนร่วมงาน)\n- **curiosity** - desire to know (ความอยากรู้)\n- **maintenance** - upkeep (การบำรุงรักษา)\n- **technician** - a skilled worker (ช่างเทคนิค)\n- **decades** - periods of ten years (ทศวรรษ)\n- **serious** - solemn (จริงจัง)\n- **ghost plane** - a rumored phantom aircraft (เครื่องบินผี)\n- **glitch** - a minor malfunction (ความผิดพลาดเล็กน้อย)\n- **disappeared** - vanished (หายไป)\n- **vanishes** - disappears (หายไป)\n- **malfunctions** - fails to work (ทำงานผิดปกติ)\n- **accidents** - unexpected events causing damage (อุบัติเหตุ)\n- **shadow** - a dark shape (เงา)\n- **uncover** - reveal (เปิดเผย)\n- **mystery** - something unexplained (ปริศนา)\n- **safety** - protection from harm (ความปลอดภัย)\n- **shiver** - a shake due to fear or cold (ตัวสั่น)\n- **spine** - the backbone (กระดูกสันหลัง)","created":"2024-08-05 12:33:37.835Z","creatorId":"","id":"wkbosw3qm4784yj","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-1.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Signal Man 1","updated":"2024-08-05 13:17:44.138Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-2.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"### Part 2: The Revelation\n\nTom couldn't shake the eerie feeling that the ghostly blip had left him with. His dreams were haunted by visions of phantom planes and empty cockpits. Determined to uncover the truth, he spent his free time researching any unusual incidents related to O'Hare Airport.\n\nOne night, as he was poring over old records and news articles, he stumbled upon a story that sent chills down his spine. It was about Flight 217, a passenger plane that had vanished without a trace twenty years ago. The flight had been en route from Chicago to New York, but it never arrived. Despite an extensive search, no wreckage or bodies were ever found. The mystery of Flight 217 remained unsolved.\n\nTom was convinced that the ghostly blip on his radar was somehow connected to Flight 217. He decided to visit the airport archives to dig deeper. The archives were located in a dimly lit basement beneath the main terminal, a place few people ever visited.\n\nAs he descended the narrow stairs, Tom felt a sense of foreboding. The air was thick with dust, and the only sound was the faint hum of the fluorescent lights. He found the section dedicated to old flight records and began his search.\n\nHours passed as he sifted through countless files and documents. Just when he was about to give up, he found a folder labeled \"Flight 217.\" His hands trembled as he opened it. Inside, he found detailed reports about the flight, the crew, and the passengers. There were also transcripts of the last communication between the pilot and the control tower.\n\nTom's eyes widened as he read the final words spoken by the pilot: \"We are encountering severe turbulence. Something is not right. I see... something in the clouds. It's coming towards us. Mayday! May—\"\n\nThe transmission ended abruptly. Tom's heart pounded as he realized that whatever had happened to Flight 217, it had happened quickly and without warning. He needed more information, so he continued to search through the folder.\n\nAt the bottom, he found a photograph that made his blood run cold. It was a picture of the control tower staff on the night Flight 217 disappeared. In the background, barely visible, was a shadowy figure standing near the radar screen. The figure was dressed in an old-fashioned uniform and had an eerie, almost translucent quality.\n\nTom knew he had to talk to someone who had been there that night. He tracked down a retired air traffic controller named Bill, who had worked the night shift when Flight 217 vanished. Bill was now living in a quiet suburb outside Chicago.\n\nWhen Tom visited Bill, he found him sitting on the porch of his small house, sipping a cup of coffee. Bill was an old man with a kind face and sharp eyes that seemed to see right through Tom.\n\n\"Hello, Bill. My name is Tom. I work at O'Hare, and I have some questions about Flight 217,\" Tom said, trying to keep his voice steady.\n\nBill nodded slowly. \"I figured someone would come asking about that flight sooner or later. Come, sit down.\"\n\nTom sat beside Bill and showed him the photograph. \"Do you remember this night?\" he asked.\n\nBill took a long look at the photo and sighed. \"I remember it like it was yesterday. That was the night everything changed.\"\n\n\"Who is this figure in the background?\" Tom asked, pointing to the shadowy figure.\n\nBill's expression grew serious. \"We called him the Signal Man. No one knew who he was or where he came from. He just appeared one night and disappeared after the flight was lost. Some said he was a ghost, a warning of impending doom.\"\n\nTom shivered. \"Do you think he's connected to the ghostly blip I've been seeing on the radar?\"\n\nBill nodded. \"It's possible. The Signal Man has been seen at other airports too, always before a disaster. If you're seeing him, you need to be very careful.\"\n\nTom left Bill's house with a heavy heart. The mystery of the Signal Man and Flight 217 was deeper than he had imagined. He knew he had to be vigilant and protect the passengers and crew of the planes he guided. The ghostly blip was more than just a glitch; it was a warning, and he had to find a way to stop whatever disaster was looming.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- **haunted** - frequently visited by ghosts or troubling memories (หลอกหลอน)\n- **visions** - images or dreams (ภาพนิมิต)\n- **phantom** - ghostly or unreal (ผี)\n- **cockpits** - areas where pilots sit (ห้องนักบิน)\n- **determined** - having a strong resolve (มุ่งมั่น)\n- **unusual** - not normal (ผิดปกติ)\n- **incidents** - events or occurrences (เหตุการณ์)\n- **records** - written documents (บันทึก)\n- **articles** - written pieces in newspapers or magazines (บทความ)\n- **passenger** - a traveler on a vehicle (ผู้โดยสาร)\n- **vanished** - disappeared suddenly (หายไป)\n- **trace** - a small sign of something (ร่องรอย)\n- **extensive** - covering a large area (กว้างขวาง)\n- **wreckage** - remains of something destroyed (ซากปรักหักพัง)\n- **archives** - a place where records are stored (คลังเอกสาร)\n- **foreboding** - a feeling of impending doom (ลางสังหรณ์)\n- **transcripts** - written records of spoken words (บันทึกการสนทนา)\n- **turbulence** - unsteady movement of air (ความปั่นป่วน)\n- **abruptly** - suddenly and unexpectedly (ฉับพลัน)\n- **folder** - a container for documents (แฟ้ม)\n- **shadowy** - dark and indistinct (คลุมเครือ)\n- **translucent** - allowing light to pass through (โปร่งแสง)\n- **retired** - no longer working (เกษียณ)\n- **suburb** - a residential area outside a city (ชานเมือง)\n- **sharp** - keen or quick (เฉียบคม)\n- **figure** - a shape or outline of someone (รูปร่าง)\n- **warning** - a notice of danger (คำเตือน)\n- **impending** - about to happen (ใกล้เข้ามา)\n- **disaster** - a sudden event causing great damage (ภัยพิบัติ)\n- **vigilant** - watchful and alert (ระมัดระวัง)","created":"2024-08-05 12:35:12.642Z","creatorId":"","id":"8ggczsq83desn16","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-2.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Signal Man 2","updated":"2024-08-05 13:17:51.659Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-3.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"### Part 3: The Confrontation\n\nTom’s determination grew stronger. He needed to prevent whatever disaster the ghostly blip was warning about. Armed with the information he had gathered, he returned to his night shifts, more vigilant than ever.\n\nOne stormy night, as lightning lit up the Chicago skyline, the ghostly blip reappeared on Tom’s radar. His heart raced, but he was prepared. He monitored the blip closely, noting its erratic movements. It seemed to be drawing a path towards a specific flight – Flight 762, en route to New York.\n\n“Flight 762, this is O’Hare Tower. Do you copy?” Tom called into his headset, his voice steady despite his fear.\n\n“Copy, O’Hare Tower. What’s the situation?” the pilot replied.\n\n“We have an unidentified object moving towards your position. Adjust your course immediately,” Tom instructed.\n\nThe pilot acknowledged and made the necessary adjustments. Tom watched the radar screen intently. The ghostly blip altered its path, still following Flight 762. Tom realized that the blip was not just a warning; it was targeting the flight.\n\nDetermined to protect the passengers, Tom knew he had to act fast. He contacted other flights in the vicinity, creating a diversion and guiding them to different altitudes and routes. The airspace over Chicago became a complex puzzle, but Tom’s skill and precision shone through. Slowly, the ghostly blip seemed to lose its target, flickering more erratically.\n\nAs the storm intensified outside, Tom felt a cold presence in the control tower. He glanced around and saw the faint outline of the Signal Man standing near the radar screen. The figure was clearer now, dressed in an old-fashioned air traffic controller uniform, his eyes fixed on Tom.\n\n“What do you want?” Tom whispered, feeling a chill run down his spine.\n\nThe Signal Man raised his hand and pointed at the radar screen. Tom looked back and saw the blip heading straight for Flight 762 again. Desperate, he tried one last maneuver.\n\n“Flight 762, this is O’Hare Tower. Climb to 35,000 feet immediately!” he commanded.\n\nThe pilot complied, and Tom watched as the plane ascended rapidly. The ghostly blip followed for a moment, then flickered violently before disappearing from the screen entirely. Tom exhaled deeply, his hands trembling.\n\nThe Signal Man's figure began to fade, but before disappearing completely, he gave Tom a solemn nod, as if acknowledging his efforts. The cold presence lifted, and the control tower felt normal again.\n\nTom's colleagues, unaware of the spectral encounter, congratulated him on averting a potential disaster. He nodded, too exhausted to explain. He knew that the ghostly blip and the Signal Man were not mere figments of his imagination. They were remnants of a tragic past, seeking resolution.\n\nIn the following days, Tom continued his research and discovered that the Signal Man had been an air traffic controller who died in a tragic accident years ago. His spirit lingered, trying to warn others and prevent similar fates. \n\nTom's experience changed him. He became more dedicated to his job, ensuring the safety of every flight. Though the ghostly blip never reappeared, Tom remained vigilant, knowing that he had encountered something beyond understanding. He had faced the unknown and emerged stronger, his story now a whispered legend among his colleagues.\n\nThe Signal Man had found peace, and so had Tom, knowing he had honored the memory of a lost soul by protecting the living.\n\n### Vocabulary List\n\n- **determination** - strong resolve (ความมุ่งมั่น)\n- **prevent** - to stop something from happening (ป้องกัน)\n- **disaster** - a sudden event causing great damage (ภัยพิบัติ)\n- **vigilant** - watchful and alert (ระมัดระวัง)\n- **erratic** - irregular or unpredictable (ไม่แน่นอน)\n- **situation** - a set of circumstances (สถานการณ์)\n- **object** - a thing (วัตถุ)\n- **adjust** - to change slightly (ปรับ)\n- **diversion** - a change in direction (การเบี่ยงเบน)\n- **altitude** - height above sea level (ระดับความสูง)\n- **targeting** - aiming at something (การเล็งเป้า)\n- **vicinity** - the area near a place (บริเวณใกล้เคียง)\n- **maneuver** - a planned movement (การเคลื่อนย้าย)\n- **intensified** - grew stronger (รุนแรงขึ้น)\n- **presence** - being in a place (การปรากฏตัว)\n- **figure** - a shape or outline of someone (รูปร่าง)\n- **uniform** - standard clothing for a job (เครื่องแบบ)\n- **whispered** - spoken softly (กระซิบ)\n- **trembling** - shaking (สั่น)\n- **solemn** - serious and sincere (จริงจัง)\n- **acknowledging** - recognizing (ยอมรับ)\n- **encounter** - a meeting (การพบปะ)\n- **spectral** - ghostly (เหมือนผี)\n- **tragedy** - a very sad event (โศกนาฏกรรม)\n- **resolution** - a solution (การแก้ปัญหา)\n- **remnants** - what is left (เศษซาก)\n- **dedicated** - devoted to a task (อุทิศ)\n- **legend** - a traditional story (ตำนาน)\n- **peace** - calm and quiet (ความสงบสุข)\n- **honored** - showed respect (ให้เกียรติ)","created":"2024-08-05 12:36:22.000Z","creatorId":"","id":"q72l0t01tyerdg0","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-3.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"The Signal Man 3","updated":"2024-08-05 13:18:02.197Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/slope.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"The term \"Slippery Slope\" is a metaphor often employed in arguments and debates. It suggests that a specific initial action could potentially trigger a sequence of events, culminating in a relatively extreme outcome. This metaphor is derived from the physical concept of sliding uncontrollably down a steep incline.\n\nThere are three types of slopes in this context: causal, precedential, and conceptual. Causal slopes revolve around the idea that a relatively minor initial action will lead to a relatively major final event. For instance, if we allow voluntary assisted suicide for terminal patients now, then it could become a commonplace way to get rid of unwanted people in order to reduce medical costs in a few years.\n\nPrecedential slopes revolve around the idea that treating a relatively minor issue a certain way now will lead to us treating a relatively major issue the same way later on. For example, if we are willing to reduce the number of jurors from 12 to 10, then why not reduce it to just 2 people, 1 person, or none at all?\n\nConceptual slopes revolve around the idea that there is no meaningful difference between two things if it's possible to get from one to the other through a series of small, nearly indistinguishable steps.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all slippery slope arguments are fallacious. They can be logically sound if the progression from the initial action to the extreme result is plausible and well-supported by evidence. The \"Slippery Slope\" argument can be fallacious when the initial step is not demonstrably likely to result in the claimed effects. This is known as the \"Slippery Slope Fallacy\".\n\nIn a fair and honest debate, it's crucial to critically evaluate slippery slope arguments and consider whether the progression they propose is reasonable and supported by evidence. If not, they may be using the slippery slope as a form of fearmongering to exaggerate the probable consequences of a given action. In a fair and honest debate, it's important to agree on what constitutes valid evidence or proof and to stick to those standards throughout the discussion. If the standards need to be adjusted, it should be done openly and with the agreement of all parties involved. Otherwise, it's just moving the goalposts.","created":"2024-03-11 06:20:22.227Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"h21fnd5xte18eex","imageUrl":"apps/assets/slope.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"The Slippery Slope","updated":"2024-03-11 06:24:01.315Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/special-acorn.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"I found a special acorn today.

It involves misrepresenting someone's position by creating a weaker, easily refutable version of it, and then attacking that distorted version instead of the actual argument. Imagine you're building a scarecrow out of straw to argue against, rather than engaging with the real person and their ideas.\n\nThis underhanded approach aims to paint the opponent's position in an unfavorable light, often by making it seem extreme or illogical. Take a debate about homework for instance. One person might argue that traditional homework assignments can be ineffective and stressful for students. A strawman response would be: \"So you think kids should never be given any responsibility and should just goof off all day?\" This deflection completely disregards the original argument, which might have centered on exploring alternative methods to reinforce learning outside of repetitive homework drills.\n\nStrawman arguments are prevalent in various contexts. Politicians might use them to discredit opposing viewpoints during campaigns. Online discussions can become riddled with strawman fallacies as users focus on quick takedowns rather than fostering genuine understanding. By being aware of this tactic, we can improve the quality of our arguments and avoid being misled by distorted presentations of opposing views.","created":"2024-03-11 06:36:42.993Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"tzxuy7b8zvjzhbj","imageUrl":"apps/assets/thinking.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"The Strawman Fallacy","updated":"2024-03-11 06:45:40.687Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/wishing-star.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Liam loved to look at the stars.

When you learn something new, the information is first stored in the hippocampus. As you revisit the information, the memory is transferred to the neocortex for long-term storage. This process is thought to be further strengthened during sleep.\n\nHere are the 3 effective study techniques:\n\n* **Test yourself** - This can be done using flashcards or quizzes. Testing yourself forces you to actively retrieve information, which strengthens the memory. Making mistakes during testing can also be beneficial, as it encourages you to activate relevant pieces of knowledge to find the answer.\n* **Interleaving** - This means mixing up the subjects you study during a single session. For example, instead of studying all of your anatomy flashcards at once, intersperse them with flashcards from another subject. This strengthens the memory by forcing your brain to retrieve information from different topics.\n* **Spacing** - This refers to spreading out your studying over multiple days. Spacing allows for rest and sleep, which is important for the brain to store and integrate information. Cramming the night before an exam is not an effective strategy in the long term.\n\nThe video concludes by mentioning a study where medical residents were trained on a surgical procedure. The group that spread their training over 4 weeks performed significantly better than the group that crammed their training into a single day. This highlights the importance of spacing your studying.\n\n**Comprehension Questions**\n\n1.  What's the difference between the hippocampus and the neocortex in terms of storing memory?\n2.

This strategy is often explained using the *Prisoner's Dilemma*, a classic problem in game theory.\n\n### What is the *Prisoner's Dilemma*?\n\nThe *Prisoner's Dilemma* involves two players who must each choose whether to cooperate with the other player or to defect (betray the other). The players cannot communicate with each other and must make their decisions at the same time. The outcomes are:\n\n- **Both cooperate**: Both get a moderate reward.\n- **One cooperates, and the other defects**: The defector gets a high reward, while the cooperator gets a very low reward.\n- **Both defect**: Both receive a low reward.\n\nThe dilemma arises because, although the best outcome for both players would be to cooperate, the fear that the other might defect leads them to choose defection, resulting in a worse outcome for both.\n\n### The Tit for Tat Strategy\n\n\"Tit for tat\" is a simple but powerful strategy used in repeated rounds of the *Prisoner's Dilemma*. The rules for \"tit for tat\" are:\n\n1. **Start by cooperating**: On the first round, always choose to cooperate.\n2. **Copy the opponent's last move**: In the following rounds, do whatever the other player did in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, continue to cooperate. If the opponent defected, respond by defecting.\n\nThis strategy encourages cooperation by being nice at the beginning. It also shows that if the opponent chooses to defect, there will be immediate consequences (retaliation in the next round). This balance of kindness and retaliation helps build trust and cooperation over time.\n\n### Why \"Tit for Tat\" Works\n\n\"Tit for tat\" became well-known when it won a computer tournament of different strategies for the repeated *Prisoner's Dilemma*, organized by political scientist Robert Axelrod in the 1980s. Despite being simple, \"tit for tat\" performed well because:\n\n- It is **nice**: It starts with cooperation, setting a positive tone.\n- It is **provocable**: It immediately punishes defection, discouraging the opponent from continuing to betray.\n- It is **forgiving**: It returns to cooperation if the opponent does, which helps restore trust.\n- It is **clear**: The strategy is easy to understand, making it predictable and encouraging the opponent to cooperate.\n\n### Adding Forgiveness: Tit for Tat with Forgiveness\n\nWhile \"tit for tat\" is effective, it can lead to endless cycles of retaliation if both players defect at some point. For example, if one player defects by mistake, \"tit for tat\" will punish them in the next round, and they may continue to retaliate against each other.\n\nTo solve this problem, a variation called **\"tit for tat with forgiveness\"** was developed. This version works the same as the original but adds a small chance of forgiving an opponent's defection. Instead of always responding with defection after the opponent defects, there is a small probability that the strategy will choose to cooperate instead. This small act of forgiveness can help break the cycle of retaliation and encourage both players to return to cooperation.","created":"2024-09-02 07:35:22.400Z","creatorId":"","id":"1xhoaot8rasg33v","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-tit-for-tat.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION","VIDEO"],"title":"Tit for Tat","updated":"2024-09-02 07:38:24.370Z","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/mScpHTIi-kM","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"en-tommys-adventure.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Tommy and his loyal dog, Max, set sail on a small boat one sunny morning.

However, there is a simple and effective way to help you learn and remember things better: spaced repetition. This technique involves reviewing material in small amounts over a longer period, rather than cramming all at once. It helps move information from your short-term memory to your long-term memory.\n\n### What is Spaced Repetition?\n\nSpaced repetition is a study method where you review what you have learned several times, with breaks in between. Instead of spending hours trying to memorize everything in one sitting, you review your notes or books for just a few minutes, several times a week. By doing this, you keep the information fresh in your mind, which helps you remember it better and for longer.\n\n### Why Does Spaced Repetition Work?\n\nWhen you learn something new, your brain stores it in your short-term memory. If you do not use or review this information, you might forget it quickly. However, when you review the information repeatedly, but with some time in between, your brain has to work a little harder to recall it. This process strengthens your memory and makes it easier to remember in the future. Each time you review the material, the time it stays in your memory gets longer.\n\n### How to Use Spaced Repetition for Studying\n\n1. **Take Short Study Sessions:** Instead of studying for hours, break your study time into shorter sessions. For example, review your notes or textbooks for 5-10 minutes between classes or before bed. This can help you keep up with your studies without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n2. **Review Regularly:** Start by reviewing the material soon after you first learn it, then review it again after a day or two, then after a week, and so on. This gradual increase in time between reviews is the key to moving information to your long-term memory.\n\n3. **Use Flashcards or Apps:** Create flashcards for key terms, formulas, or concepts. There are also many apps designed for spaced repetition, such as Anki or Quizlet, which can help you organize your study material and remind you when it is time to review.\n\n4. **Focus on Weak Areas:** Pay extra attention to the material you find most difficult. Review these areas more frequently until you feel confident about them. Spaced repetition allows you to identify which topics need more practice and which you already know well.\n\n5. **Use Your Free Time:** Make the most of small pockets of time, like waiting for the bus or sitting in between classes. Reviewing during these short breaks can add up over time and significantly improve your memory.\n\n### Benefits of Spaced Repetition\n\nSpaced repetition helps you study smarter, not harder. It saves time by focusing on what you need to remember, helps reduce stress by preventing last-minute cramming, and improves your understanding and recall of information over time. Plus, it fits easily into your daily routine, making studying less of a chore.\n\nBy reviewing your notes regularly and using spaced repetition, you can turn studying into a more effective and enjoyable process. Remember, it is not about the number of hours you study but how well you use your time. Start using spaced repetition today, and see the difference it makes in your learning!\n\n### Vocabulary\n\n- Spaced repetition - การทบทวนแบบเว้นระยะ\n- Study method - วิธีการเรียน\n- Review - ทบทวน\n- Material - เนื้อหา\n- Memory - ความจำ\n- Short-term memory - ความจำระยะสั้น\n- Long-term memory - ความจำระยะยาว\n- Learn - เรียนรู้\n- Recall - จำได้\n- Strengthen - เสริมสร้าง\n- Future - อนาคต\n- Session - ช่วงเวลา\n- Textbooks - หนังสือเรียน\n- Formula - สูตร\n- Concepts - แนวคิด\n- Flashcards - บัตรคำ\n- Identify - ระบุ\n- Focus - มุ่งเน้น\n- Weak areas - จุดที่อ่อน\n- Practice - ฝึกฝน\n- Free time - เวลาว่าง\n- Benefits - ประโยชน์\n- Effective - มีประสิทธิภาพ\n- Cramming - การท่องจำแบบยัดเยียด\n- Routine - กิจวัตรประจำวัน\n- Process - กระบวนการ\n- Understanding - ความเข้าใจ\n- Recall - การจำได้\n- Learning - การเรียนรู้","created":"2024-09-02 00:30:12.134Z","creatorId":"","id":"88yc9llj5nrmnpx","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-spaced-repetition.webp","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Using Spaced Repetition to Study Effectively","updated":"2024-09-02 00:33:08.636Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/people.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"What's the difference between person, persons, people, and peoples?\n\nThe words **people** and **persons** are both plural forms of the singular noun **person**.

How to Approach Your Teacher with Concerns\n\nGetting a disappointing grade on a paper you worked hard on is a major bummer. It's easy to feel frustrated and even assume your teacher was just being difficult. However, before jumping to conclusions, consider that other factors might have been at play.  The reality is, even the best teachers aren't robots – they're susceptible to something called \"noise\". This refers to things like fatigue, mood, and even the time of day, which can unconsciously affect how they grade.  Studies suggest papers graded later in a long session might receive harsher feedback due to a teacher's mental exhaustion.\n\nSo, what can you do if you suspect your grade isn't entirely fair? First, resist the urge to confront your teacher immediately. Give yourself a day to calm down and reread your paper along with any feedback provided. Try to identify specific areas where you feel the grading might have been inconsistent or where comments don't quite match your understanding of the assignment.\n\nWhen approaching your teacher, focus on expressing a desire to improve. Instead of launching accusations of unfairness, frame your concerns constructively.  Say something like, \"I noticed I lost points on [section], and I'm struggling to understand why. Could we discuss this so I can improve on the next assignment?\"\n\nRemember, most teachers genuinely want you to succeed, and they're not out to deliberately sabotage your grades. Approaching a grading concern isn't about getting excuses or changing one grade; it's about identifying areas for improvement and potentially creating a more consistent grading experience for yourself and your classmates. It takes courage, but it's a worthwhile step in your learning journey!","created":"2024-03-07 09:35:17.733Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"ewn4qvwyu7ckn3t","imageUrl":"apps/assets/unfair.jpg","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","SCHOOL","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Was Your Grade Unfair?","updated":"2024-03-08 01:48:10.735Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/processed-food.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"The term \"processed food\" can be quite vague. To get a clearer picture, let's break it down into different levels of processing:\n\n**1) Minimally processed foods:** These have undergone basic procedures like washing, cutting, freezing, drying, or pasteurizing. Examples include frozen fruits and vegetables, canned beans, canned tuna, unsalted nuts, and yogurt. These foods retain most of their nutrients and can be healthy choices.\n\n**2) Moderately processed foods:** These involve combining minimally processed foods with some added ingredients like spices, oils, or preservatives. Examples include frozen dinners, canned pasta sauce, salad dressing, bread, and cheese. These can be part of a healthy diet in moderation, but pay attention to added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.\n\n**3) Heavily processed foods:** These go through more extensive processing and often contain a longer list of ingredients, including artificial flavors, colors, and sweeteners. Examples include packaged snacks, chips, cookies, instant noodles, pre-made sandwiches, and sugary drinks. These tend to be higher in unhealthy fats, sugar, and salt, and should be limited in a healthy diet.\n\n**4) Ultra-processed foods:** These are the most concerning, made primarily from industrial ingredients and additives rather than whole foods. They often have a long shelf life and rely heavily on marketing tactics to appeal to consumers. Examples include candy, packaged cookies, soda, microwaveable meals, and frozen pizza. These offer little nutritional value and should be avoided as much as possible.\n\nHere are some additional tips to help you navigate the world of processed foods:\n\n- Read the ingredient list: Look for short lists of whole ingredients you can recognize. \n- Pay attention to added sugars, unhealthy fats, and salt: These are often high in processed foods.\n- Choose whole foods over processed versions: Opt for fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources.\n- Cook at home more often: This gives you control over the ingredients and allows you to create healthier meals.\n- Don't demonize all processed foods: Some minimally or moderately processed foods can be part of a healthy diet.\n\nMaking whole foods the core of your diet is the best way to ensure you're getting the nutrients you need to thrive.\n","created":"2024-01-03 13:56:42.924Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"hbb3zzoouu3s9g8","imageUrl":"apps/assets/food.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","SCIENCE"],"title":"What are \"Processed Foods?\"","updated":"2024-01-03 14:26:20.689Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/floaters.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Below is some background information that you can study before watching the video.\n\nFloaters are tiny objects that float inside your eye. They are not actually bugs or anything that gets into your eye from the outside. They are made up of bits of tissue, red blood cells, or protein clumps that are inside the gel-like liquid that fills your eye.\n\nFloaters appear to move and change shape because they are casting shadows on your retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. As your eye moves, the floaters move and cast different shadows.\n\nYou may not notice floaters most of the time, but they become more visible when you are looking at a bright, uniform surface, such as a blank computer screen, snow, or a clear blue sky. This is because the contrast between the floaters and the background makes them easier to see.\n\nFloaters are usually harmless, and most people don't need to worry about them.

Nouns name people, places, or things, like \"Sarah,\" \"school,\" or \"dog.\" Pronouns make our sentences shorter and easier to understand.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nInstead of saying \"Sarah went to the park. Sarah had fun,\" you can say \"Sarah went to the park. She had fun.\"\n\nInstead of saying \"The dog played with the ball. The dog was tired,\" you can say, \"The dog played with the ball. It was tired.\"\n\n**Common pronouns** \n\nI: Use \"I\" when talking about yourself. \"I like pizza.\"\nYou: Use \"you\" when talking to someone else. \"You are my friend.\"\nHe: Use \"he\" when talking about a boy or a man. \"He is playing soccer.\"\nShe: Use \"she\" when talking about a girl or a woman. \"She is reading a book.\"\nIt: Use \"it\" when talking about a thing, animal, or place. \"It is a sunny day.\"\nWe: Use \"we\" when talking about yourself and others. \"We are going to the store.\"\nThey: Use \"they\" when talking about a group of people or things. \"They ate all the cookies.\"\n\n### What is the singular \"they\"?\n\nThe singular \"they\"  is using the pronouns \"they\", \"them\", \"their,\" and \"themselves\" to refer to one person.  There are two main ways it's used:\n\n1. When you don't know the person's gender:\n\n\"Someone left their phone on the table. I hope they come back for it.\"\n\n2. When the person's gender is non-binary:\n\n\"My friend Alex uses they/them pronouns. They are a great artist.\"\n\n### Why is it important?\n\n**Inclusivity**: It allows us to be respectful of people's gender identities, especially those who don't identify as strictly male or female.\n\n**Convenience**: In the past, we might awkwardly say \"he or she\" when we didn't know someone's gender. Singular \"they\" is simpler.\n\n### Is it grammatically correct?\n\nYes! While some people still debate it, singular \"they\" has been used for centuries. Major dictionaries and style guides recognize it as standard English, especially in its non-binary use.\n\n[Practice Problems - English-Hilfen.de](https://www.englisch-hilfen.de/en/exercises_list/pronomen.htm)\n\n\n","created":"2024-02-27 02:03:50.781Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"zbyimb3yvzcohud","imageUrl":"apps/assets/grammar.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["GRAMMAR"],"title":"What are pronouns?","updated":"2024-02-27 02:17:56.871Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/syllable-stress.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"In English, syllables are the building blocks of words and are made up of one or more vowel sounds. When a word has more than one syllable, one of the syllables is stressed, meaning it is pronounced with more emphasis than the other syllables. The stressed syllable is usually louder, longer, and higher in pitch than the other syllables. The position of the stress in a word can change the meaning of the word. For example, the word \"present\" can be a noun or a verb depending on which syllable is stressed. When the first syllable is stressed, it is a noun meaning a gift, while when the second syllable is stressed, it is a verb meaning to show or offer.\n\nThere are different patterns of syllable stress in English, but some common ones include:\n\n**First syllable stress** - In this pattern, the first syllable of the word is stressed. Examples include \"happy,\" \"table,\" and \"apple.\"\n\n**Second syllable stress** - In this pattern, the second syllable of the word is stressed. Examples include \"banana,\" \"potato,\" and \"tomato.\"\n\n**Third syllable stress** - In this pattern, the third syllable of the word is stressed. Examples include \"photography,\" \"university,\" and \"television.\"\n\nYou can check how many syllables a word has by putting your hand under your chin and saying the word. Each time your chin moves to make a vowel sound, count a syllable. For example, the word \"computer\" has three syllables: com / pu / ter.\n\n\n","created":"2023-12-28 05:17:10.817Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"i0zl3s70ujjrtfd","imageUrl":"apps/assets/grammar.png","language":"English","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","GRAMMAR"],"title":"What is Syllable Stress?","updated":"2023-12-28 05:24:51.667Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/fake-news.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Why do smart people sometimes fall for misleading stories and outright lies? The answer isn't that they're unintelligent, but that our brains have certain flaws that make us naturally susceptible to fake news. This has nothing to do with how much information we have and everything to do with how our brains process that information.\n\nThis flaw is called a cognitive bias. It's like a mental shortcut our brains take that can often lead us to bad judgments. One big culprit is confirmation bias: we naturally love information that supports what we already believe and are less likely to accept things that challenge our worldview. It feels good to be right!\n\nA fascinating study revealed this. People were shown arguments both for and against a hot-button issue.

You're not alone. Probability, the mathematical study of chance, often defies our gut feelings.  It turns out our brains are hardwired in ways that make understanding probability anything but intuitive.\n\nOur brains are superb pattern-finding machines. This skill helped our ancestors survive, but it can backfire when dealing with the randomness of probability. We tend to see cause-and-effect where only coincidence exists and prefer comforting narratives to cold mathematical chance. Additionally, we often fall prey to mental shortcuts called heuristics and biases. These might help make quick everyday decisions, but they frequently lead us astray in the realm of probability.  Think of how easily a vivid news story about an unlikely event can skew our perception of how often it actually occurs.\n\nWe also struggle with large numbers and proportions, essential building blocks for calculating probability.  Plus,  deep down, humans aren't a huge fan of randomness – it can make us feel like we lack control. This discomfort can make us mistakenly seek patterns or explanations when none exist.\n\nClassic puzzles like the [Birthday Paradox](https://purplepeoplesreader.com/English/ztesnud7xvjozzq) (where it's surprisingly likely two people in a small group will share a birthday) or the [Monty Hall Problem](https://purplepeoplesreader.com/English/5sgggvdwngtzw98) (where switching your choice counterintuitively boosts your chances of winning) perfectly highlight how our brains clash with probability.

Sie hatte bald nach ihrer Hochzeit ihren Mann verloren. Jetzt saß sie arm und verlassen in ihrer kleinen Stube und wartete auf ihr Kind. Dieses Kind sollte keinen Vater haben. Weil sie so ganz allein war, dachte sie immer an ihr erwartetes Kind. Sie träumte von einem schönen Leben für ihr Kind. Ein Haus mit einem Garten und einem Springbrunnen schien ihr für das Kind gerade gut genug. Sie wünschte sich, dass ihr Kind mindestens Professor oder König werden sollte.\n\nNeben der armen Frau Elisabeth wohnte ein alter Mann, Herr Binßwanger. Er war klein und trug eine Trottelmütze und einen grünen Regenschirm. Die Kinder hatten Angst vor ihm, aber Elisabeth mochte ihn. Sie grüßten sich immer freundlich. Eines Abends kam Herr Binßwanger zu Elisabeths Haus und brachte eine alte Frau mit. Diese alte Frau half Elisabeth, als ihr Kind geboren wurde. Elisabeth war sehr dankbar.\n\nDas Kind wurde Augustus genannt. Als er geboren wurde, wünschte sich seine Mutter, dass alle Menschen ihn lieben würden. Diesen Wunsch flüsterte sie ihm ins Ohr, als eine schöne Musik von Herrn Binßwangers Haus herüberklang. Die Musik hörte auf, und es war ganz still im Zimmer. Elisabeth weinte und dachte: „Jetzt habe ich dir das Beste gewünscht, was ich weiß.“\n\n### Teil 2: Der kleine Augustus\nAugustus wuchs wie andere Kinder heran. Er war ein hübscher, blonder Junge mit hellen, mutigen Augen. Seine Mutter verwöhnte ihn, und er war überall beliebt. Elisabeth merkte bald, dass ihr Wunsch sich erfüllte. Überall fanden die Leute Augustus hübsch und klug. Junge Mütter lächelten ihm zu, und alte Frauen schenkten ihm Äpfel. Wenn er etwas Unartiges tat, verzieh man ihm schnell.\n\nNebenan rief Herr Binßwanger Augustus manchmal am Abend in sein Haus. Im dunklen Zimmer saßen sie zusammen am Kamin. Der alte Mann erzählte Augustus lange Geschichten. Manchmal erklang eine süße, vielstimmige Musik, und kleine Engel mit goldenen Flügeln flogen in der Stube umher. Augustus liebte diese Abende bei seinem Paten sehr.\n\nAls Augustus größer wurde, war Elisabeth manchmal traurig. Augustus spielte fröhlich in den Nachbargassen und kam oft spät nach Hause. Man gab ihm zu essen und zu trinken, und er war überall willkommen. Zuhause schob er die Suppe seiner Mutter oft beiseite und war mürrisch. Wenn Elisabeth ihn schalt, schrie er, dass alle anderen nett zu ihm seien, nur sie nicht. Dann war sie oft betrübt und dachte: „Vielleicht wäre es besser gewesen, ich hätte diesen Wunsch niemals getan.“\n\nEines Tages stand Elisabeth am Fenster und schnitt verwelkte Blumen von Herrn Binßwangers Geranien ab. Sie sah Augustus im Hof mit einem Mädchen sprechen. Das Mädchen bat ihn um einen Kuss, aber Augustus sagte: „Ich mag nicht.“ Das Mädchen bot ihm zwei Äpfel und einen Fingerring an. Schließlich gab Augustus dem Mädchen einen flüchtigen Kuss, nahm den Ring und lief davon. Elisabeth sah dies und war erschrocken über die Härte und Verächtlichkeit ihres Sohnes. Sie dachte: „Er ist ja böse, er hat ja gar kein Herz.“\n\nDoch später, als Augustus nach Hause kam und sie ihn zur Rede stellte, schaute er sie lachend an und sang. Er war so drollig und nett, dass sie lachen musste. Sie wusste, dass man bei Kindern nicht alles so ernst nehmen darf.\n\n### Teil 3: Augustus und sein Pate\nAugustus war nun zwölf Jahre alt. Der Pate Binßwanger war der einzige, vor dem er Respekt hatte. Wenn Augustus am Abend zu ihm kam und der Pate sagte: „Heute brennt kein Feuer im Kamin, und es gibt keine Musik. Die kleinen Engel sind traurig, weil du so böse warst,“ dann ging Augustus schweigend nach Hause und weinte. Danach bemühte er sich, gut und lieb zu sein.\n\nDas Feuer im Kamin brannte jedoch seltener. Augustus vergaß den Engelflug in der Patenstube langsam. Als eines Tages sein Lehrer zu Elisabeth kam und sagte, jemand wolle Augustus in fremde Schulen schicken, um zu studieren, war sie besorgt. Sie sprach mit Herrn Binßwanger, und bald darauf, an einem Frühlingsmorgen, kam ein Wagen. Augustus trug ein neues, schönes Kleid und stieg in den Wagen. Er sagte seiner Mutter und dem Paten Lebewohl, denn er sollte in die Hauptstadt reisen, um zu studieren.\n\nElisabeth hatte ihm zum letzten Mal die blonden Haare schön gescheitelt und den Segen über ihn gesprochen. Nun zogen die Pferde an, und Augustus reiste in die fremde Welt.\n\n### Teil 4: Augustus als Student\nNach vielen Jahren wurde Augustus ein Student. Er trug eine rote Mütze und einen Schnurrbart. Eines Tages schrieb ihm Herr Binßwanger, dass seine Mutter sehr krank sei und nicht mehr lange leben würde. Augustus kam sofort nach Hause. Die Leute bewunderten den schönen Studenten, als er aus dem Wagen stieg und seinen Koffer ins Haus trug.\n\nElisabeth lag sterbend in ihrem Bett. Als Augustus das weiße, welkende Gesicht seiner Mutter sah, kniete er weinend nieder und küsste ihre kühlen Hände. Er blieb die ganze Nacht bei ihr, bis sie starb. Nach der Beerdigung nahm ihn Herr Binßwanger in sein Haus. Der kleine alte Mann zündete ein Feuer im Kamin an, und sie saßen zusammen davor. Der Pate sagte: „Ich weiß, du musst morgen wieder abreisen. Jetzt, wo deine Mutter tot ist, wirst du so bald nicht wiederkommen.“\n\nDer Pate wünschte ihm alles Gute und sagte, dass seine Mutter viel für ihn getan habe. Er sagte auch, dass Augustus vielleicht eines Tages die Engel wieder sehen und ihre Musik hören könnte, wenn er mit einem einsamen und sehnsüchtigen Herzen nach ihnen verlangte. Augustus ging traurig zurück in das verlassene Haus seiner Mutter und schlief ein letztes Mal dort.\n\nAm nächsten Morgen reiste Augustus wieder ab, und die Menschen hörten lange nichts mehr von ihm.\n\n### Teil 5: Augustus und das Leben in der Fremde\nIn der fremden Stadt führte Augustus ein aufregendes Leben. Er ritt durch die Straßen und grüßte die Mädchen mit spöttischen Blicken. Er tanzte, fuhr mit schönen Wagen und feierte prunkvolle Nächte. Eine reiche Witwe, deren Geliebter er war, gab ihm Geld, Kleider und Pferde. Mit ihr reiste er nach Paris und Rom.\n\nDoch seine wahre Liebe war eine sanfte, blonde Bürgerstochter, die er nachts heimlich besuchte. Sie schrieb ihm lange, heiße Briefe, wenn er auf Reisen war. Doch eines Tages kehrte Augustus nicht mehr zurück. Er hatte neue Freunde in Paris gefunden und blieb dort.\n\nIn Paris lebte er ein wildes Leben. Er hielt Pferde, Hunde und hatte viele Frauen. Er verlor Geld und gewann es wieder in großen Mengen. Überall bewunderten und liebten ihn die Menschen. Aber Augustus spürte kaum, dass sein Herz leer und habgierig war und seine Seele krank und leidend.\n\nManchmal wurde ihm das Leben, in dem ihn alle liebten, langweilig. Dann verkleidete er sich und ging allein durch fremde Städte. Er fand die Menschen töricht und ihre Liebe lächerlich. Frauen und Männer ekelten ihn oft an, weil sie so wenig Stolz hatten. Ganze Tage verbrachte er allein mit seinen Hunden oder auf der Jagd.\n\n### Teil 6: Die Begegnung mit der stolzen Dame\nAuf einer Seereise traf Augustus eine junge Frau, die ihn tief beeindruckte. Sie war die Frau eines Gesandten, eine stolze und schweigsame Dame aus einem nordländischen Adel. Augustus beschloss, ihre Liebe zu gewinnen. Er war ständig in ihrer Nähe, doch nie gelang es ihm, mit ihr allein zu sein.\n\nEines Tages legte das Schiff in einer Hafenstadt an, und die Reisenden gingen an Land, um die Stadt zu erkunden. Augustus nutzte die Gelegenheit und führte die Dame in eine schmale Gasse. Dort, wo niemand sie sehen konnte, nahm er ihre Hand und bat sie flehend, mit ihm zu fliehen und am Land zu bleiben.\n\nDie Dame sah ihn ernst an und sagte leise: „Das ist nicht ritterlich. Lassen Sie mich vergessen, was Sie gesagt haben!“ Augustus betonte, dass er kein Ritter sei, sondern ein Liebender. Doch sie wies ihn zurück, erklärte ihm, dass sie zwar Gefühle für ihn habe, aber ihren ehrenhaften Mann nicht verlassen könne. Verzweifelt brachte Augustus sie zurück zum Schiff und verabschiedete sich.\n\n### Teil 7: Der Niedergang\nNach dieser Begegnung änderte sich Augustus' Leben drastisch. Er verachtete Tugend und Ehrbarkeit und trat sie mit Füßen. Sein Vergnügen lag nun darin, tugendhafte Frauen zu verführen und arglose Menschen auszunutzen. Er machte Frauen und Mädchen arm und verführte Jünglinge aus edlen Häusern. Kein Genuss und kein Laster blieben ihm fremd, doch Freude fand er in nichts.\n\nIn einem schönen Landhaus am Meer lebte er finster und verbittert. Er quälte die Frauen und Freunde, die ihn besuchten, mit seinen Launen und Bosheiten. Die Menschen, die ihm früher folgten, begannen sich von ihm abzuwenden. Augustus fühlte sich einsam und leer, und in seinem Herzen war keine Freude mehr.\n\nEine tiefe Unzufriedenheit und eine Sehnsucht nach etwas Unerreichbarem nagten an ihm. Er erkannte den Unwert seines Lebens und sehnte sich danach, die Menschen zu erniedrigen und ihre Liebe zu verspüren, doch nichts erfüllte ihn. Augustus' einst so bewunderte Macht und Anziehungskraft schwanden, und sein Leben wurde immer trostloser.\n\n### Teil 8: Die Rückkehr des Paten\nAugustus beschloss, ein großes Fest zu geben und dann sein Leben mit Gift zu beenden. Am Abend vor dem Fest schickte er seine Dienerschaft weg, damit das Haus still und leer war. Er bereitete das Gift vor und wollte es gerade trinken, als an seine Tür geklopft wurde. Ein kleiner alter Mann trat ein - es war Herr Binßwanger.\n\nDer Pate nahm Augustus das Giftglas aus der Hand und trank es selbst. Augustus schrie verzweifelt: „Weißt du, was du da getrunken hast?“ Der Pate nickte ruhig und sagte: „Es ist Zeit für uns zu reden, Augustus.“ Sie setzten sich, und der Pate erzählte Augustus, dass der Wunsch seiner Mutter ein Fluch geworden sei, weil er von allen Menschen geliebt wurde, aber niemanden wirklich lieben konnte.\n\nHerr Binßwanger bot Augustus an, ihm einen neuen Wunsch zu erfüllen. Augustus überlegte lange und sagte schließlich: „Ich wünsche mir, die Menschen lieben zu können.“ Der Pate lächelte und legte Augustus ins Bett. Augustus fühlte sich von einer schweren Müdigkeit überfallen und schlief tief und fest ein.\n\n### Teil 9: Ein neues Leben\nAm nächsten Morgen erwachte Augustus und fand sein Haus leer. Seine Freunde kamen zum Fest, fanden jedoch kein Essen und keine Unterhaltung. Stattdessen schimpften und schlugen sie ihn. Augustus erkannte, dass seine Macht über die Menschen verschwunden war. Er wurde ins Gefängnis geworfen und stand vor Gericht. Niemand verteidigte ihn, und alle klagten ihn an.\n\nIm Gefängnis litt Augustus sehr. Er dachte an seine Mutter, seine erste Liebe und den Paten. Er fühlte tiefen Schmerz und Sehnsucht nach menschlicher Nähe. Als er schließlich entlassen wurde, war er krank und alt, und niemand erkannte ihn. Er war nun arm und obdachlos.\n\nDoch Augustus war nicht mehr einsam. Er begann, die Menschen um sich herum zu lieben. Er half kleinen Kindern, die die Tür zum Bäcker nicht öffnen konnten, und unterstützte Blinde und Gelähmte. Er grüßte freundlich und schenkte anderen Menschen ein Lächeln oder einen freundlichen Blick.\n\nAugustus beschloss, durch die Welt zu wandern und den Menschen zu dienen. Er fand Freude daran, die Kinder spielen zu sehen und alte Leute in der Sonne sitzen zu sehen. Die Menschen beachteten ihn nicht, aber das störte ihn nicht. Er war glücklich, ihnen etwas Gutes zu tun, auch wenn es nur ein freundliches Wort oder eine kleine Hilfe war.\n\n### Teil 10: Die Rückkehr nach Hause\nNach vielen Jahren des Wanderns und Helfens fühlte Augustus, dass seine Zeit knapp wurde. Sein Haar war grau geworden, und seine Augen lächelten müde hinter roten, kranken Lidern. Er war zufrieden mit seinem Leben, auch wenn es ihm oft schwer fiel. Er fand die Welt trotz allem herrlich und liebenswert.\n\nIm Winter kam Augustus in eine Stadt. Der Schnee trieb durch die dunklen Straßen, und Augustus fühlte sich sehr müde. Er erkannte die schmale Gasse, in der er sich befand, und schließlich stand er vor dem Haus seiner Mutter und dem Haus von Herrn Binßwanger. Das Fenster des Paten war hell erleuchtet, und Augustus ging hinein.\n\nHerr Binßwanger empfing ihn schweigend und führte ihn in die warme Stube. Sie setzten sich zusammen vor das kleine Feuer im Kamin. „Bist du hungrig?“ fragte der Pate, doch Augustus schüttelte den Kopf. „Aber müde wirst du sein?“ fragte der Pate wieder. Augustus nickte und legte sich auf das alte Fell am Boden.\n\n„Du hast einen weiten Weg hinter dir,“ sagte der Pate. „Darf ich bei dir schlafen? Dann will ich morgen weitergehen,“ fragte Augustus. „Ja, das kannst du,“ antwortete der Pate. „Und willst du nicht auch die Engel wieder tanzen sehen?“ fragte er. „Die Engel? O ja, das will ich wohl, wenn ich einmal wieder ein Kind sein werde,“ sagte Augustus.\n\nDie beiden alten Männer saßen nebeneinander und sahen ins Feuer. Eine feine, frohe Musik erklang, und tausend kleine, strahlende Geister kreisten durch die Luft. Augustus schaute und lauschte mit all seinen Sinnen. Er fühlte sich, als hätte ihn seine Mutter gerufen, doch er war zu müde, um zu antworten.\n\nAugustus schlief ein, und der Pate legte ihm die Hände zusammen und lauschte an seinem stillen Herzen, bis es in der Stube völlig Nacht geworden war.\n\n[Read on LanguageCrush](https://languagecrush.com/reading/47036/read)\n","created":"2024-08-01 05:06:01.567Z","creatorId":"","id":"ii7o2cc9d18n3ku","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/de-mother-wish.webp","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","STORY"],"title":"Augustus by Hermann Hesse in Easy German","updated":"2024-09-21 05:52:36.797Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/german-01.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"\n## Greetings and Politeness\n\n* Guten Tag\n* Hallo \n* Guten Morgen \n* Guten Abend\n* Auf Wiedersehen\n* Tschüß\n* Danke\n* Bitte \n* Bitte schön\n* Entschuldigung \n* Es tut mir leid \n\n## Questions\n \n* Wie geht es Ihnen? \n* Wie geht's? \n* Sprechen Sie Englisch?\n* Ich spreche kein Deutsch. \n* Könnten Sie das bitte wiederholen? \n* Ich verstehe nicht.\n\n## Directions and Transportation\n\n* Wo ist...? \n* In welcher Richtung ist...? \n* Ist es in der Nähe? \n* Ist es weit weg? \n* Zum Bahnhof, bitte. \n* Zum Flughafen, bitte. \n* Zum Stadtzentrum, bitte. \n* Wo ist die Bushaltestelle?\n* Wo ist die U-Bahn? \n* Wie viel kostet eine Fahrkarte nach...? \n* Fährt dieser Zug nach...? \n* Wohin fährt dieser Bus? \n\n## Numbers\n \n* eins\n* zwei\n* drei \n* vier \n* fünf \n* sechs \n* sieben\n* acht\n* neun\n* zehn\n\n## Food and Drink\n\n* Was möchten Sie trinken? \n* Was möchten Sie essen? \n* Die Rechnung, bitte. \n* Ich hätte gerne... \n\n## Other Useful Phrases\n\n* Ich brauche Hilfe.\n* Wo ist die Toilette?\n* Ist das rauchfrei? \n* Kann ich bezahlen mit...?\n* Ich habe eine Reservierung.","created":"2024-01-03 07:32:32.320Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"43204ryk0ya185k","imageUrl":"apps/assets/germany.jpg","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["A1"],"title":"Basic German Travel Phrases","updated":"2024-01-03 07:44:57.440Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"wald-1.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Teil 1: Die Reise beginnt\nLena war eine junge Botanikerin.

Also packte sie ihre Sachen und machte sich auf den Weg in den Wald.\n\nDer Thüringer Wald war groß und geheimnisvoll. Die Bäume waren alt und hoch. Die Blätter raschelten im Wind und die Vögel sangen. Lena fühlte sich glücklich und frei. Sie wanderte den ganzen Tag und sammelte viele Pflanzenproben.\n\nAm Abend fand Lena einen schönen Platz zum Zelten. Sie baute ihr Zelt auf und machte ein kleines Feuer. Die Sonne ging unter und die Sterne kamen heraus. Der Wald war nun still und dunkel. Lena legte sich in ihr Zelt und schlief bald ein.\n\nMitten in der Nacht wachte Lena auf. Sie hörte ein seltsames Geräusch. Es klang wie ein Flüstern. Lena setzte sich auf und lauschte. Das Flüstern kam aus dem Wald. Es war unheimlich, aber auch faszinierend. Lena nahm ihre Taschenlampe und ging nach draußen.\n\nDas Flüstern wurde lauter. Lena folgte dem Geräusch tiefer in den Wald. Sie war neugierig, aber auch ein bisschen ängstlich.

Lena sammelte ihren Mut und ging näher.\n\n„Hallo?“ rief sie leise. „Ist da jemand?“\n\nDer Schatten antwortete nicht. Lena fühlte sich mutiger und machte noch einen Schritt. Dann sah sie es.

Lena spürte keinen Zorn oder Angst von der Kreatur. Sie war einfach nur da.\n\nLena war überrascht, aber sie fühlte sich nicht bedroht. „Wer bist du?“ fragte sie.\n\nDie Kreatur antwortete nicht. Sie stand einfach da und sah Lena an. Lena wusste nicht, was sie tun sollte. Sie wollte mehr wissen, aber sie hatte auch Angst. Schließlich machte sie einen Schritt zurück. „Ich werde morgen wiederkommen,“ sagte sie leise. Dann drehte sie sich um und ging zurück zu ihrem Zelt.\n\nIn dieser Nacht konnte Lena kaum schlafen. Sie dachte die ganze Zeit an die Kreatur aus Schatten. Wer oder was war es? Warum war es hier im Wald? Lena wusste, dass sie Antworten finden musste.

Sie ging langsam und aufmerksam, immer auf der Suche nach Anzeichen der Kreatur.\n\nNach einigen Stunden hörte sie wieder das Flüstern. Es war leise, aber klar. Lena folgte dem Geräusch, bis sie zu einer Lichtung kam. Dort, im Schatten der Bäume, stand die Kreatur. Sie sah genauso aus wie in der Nacht zuvor, ein Wesen aus reiner Dunkelheit.\n\nLena blieb stehen und hob die Hand. „Hallo,“ sagte sie leise. Die Kreatur bewegte sich nicht. Lena machte einen Schritt näher. „Ich bin Lena. Wer bist du?“\n\nDie Kreatur sah sie an, aber sagte nichts. Lena spürte keine Feindseligkeit. Sie fühlte sich sicher, obwohl die Situation ungewöhnlich war. Sie setzte sich auf einen Baumstamm und wartete. Vielleicht würde die Kreatur ihr Vertrauen gewinnen.\n\nStunden vergingen und Lena sprach weiter. Sie erzählte der Kreatur von ihrer Arbeit, ihrer Liebe zu Pflanzen und ihrem Wunsch, den Wald zu erforschen. Die Kreatur hörte zu, ohne ein Wort zu sagen. Doch Lena spürte eine Verbindung.

Es klang wie das Kichern einer alten Frau. Lena blieb stehen und lauschte. Das Kichern kam näher. Lena wusste, dass sie die Hexe gefunden hatte.

Blitze erhellten den Himmel und Donner grollte in der Ferne. Die Dorfbewohner blieben in ihren Häusern, denn niemand wollte sich in der Nähe der alten Kirche aufhalten. Sie stand am Rand des Dorfes, umgeben von hohen Bäumen und dicken Nebelschwaden. Man sagte, sie sei verflucht.\n\nJohann, ein junger und neugieriger Mann, hatte oft Geschichten über die Kirche gehört. Die Ältesten des Dorfes erzählten von Geistern und unerklärlichen Ereignissen. Doch Johann glaubte nicht an solche Märchen. Eines Abends, als der Sturm am stärksten wütete, beschloss er, das Geheimnis der Kirche selbst zu erkunden.\n\nMit einer Laterne und einem Mut, der an Leichtsinn grenzte, machte sich Johann auf den Weg. Der Regen prasselte auf sein Gesicht, als er den Pfad zur Kirche entlangging. Die alten Bäume bogen sich im Wind und schienen zu flüstern. Endlich erreichte er die schwere Holztür der Kirche. Sie war alt und von der Zeit gezeichnet. Johann zögerte kurz, dann schob er die Tür auf.\n\nEin kalter Wind wehte ihm entgegen. Drinnen war es dunkel und still. Johann hob seine Laterne und sah, dass die Bänke mit einer dicken Staubschicht bedeckt waren. Spinnweben hingen von der Decke, und der Boden knarrte unter seinen Schritten. Die Kirche war verlassen, das war klar. Doch warum flüsterten die Dorfbewohner, dass sie verflucht sei?\n\nJohann ging langsam durch das Kirchenschiff. Plötzlich hörte er ein leises, unheimliches Flüstern. Er blieb stehen und lauschte. Das Flüstern kam von den Wänden, als ob die Steine selbst sprechen würden. Ein kalter Schauer lief ihm über den Rücken, aber er beschloss, weiterzugehen.\n\nEr erreichte den Altar und sah eine alte, verfallene Treppe, die in die Krypta unter der Kirche führte. Das Flüstern wurde lauter. Johann nahm all seinen Mut zusammen und begann, die Treppe hinunterzusteigen. Jeder Schritt hallte in der Dunkelheit wider.\n\nUnten angekommen, fand er sich in einem kalten, feuchten Raum wieder. Die Luft war schwer und roch nach Moder. An den Wänden hingen uralte Gemälde, die Szenen von Tod und Trauer darstellten. In der Mitte des Raumes standen mehrere Steinsärge, die mit dicken Spinnweben bedeckt waren.\n\nJohann trat näher an die Särge heran, als plötzlich ein eisiger Wind durch die Krypta wehte und die Flamme seiner Laterne flackerte. Er hörte das Flüstern jetzt deutlicher, als ob eine Stimme direkt in seinem Ohr sprach. \"Hilf mir...\", flüsterte es.\n\nJohann drehte sich schnell um, aber da war niemand. Das Flüstern kam aus der Tiefe der Krypta, und Johann wusste, dass er das Geheimnis dieser Kirche lüften musste. Mit zitternden Händen hob er die Laterne und ging tiefer in die Dunkelheit.\n\nTeil 2\n\n**Krypta (crypt), steinsärge (stone coffins), grabsteine (gravestones), nische (niche), weinende (weeping), kerze (candle), medaillon (medallion), geheimnis (secret), tagebuch (diary), pfarrer (priest), mädchen (girl), stimmen (voices), schuld (guilt), schreie (screams), frieden (peace), mut (courage), dunkelheit (darkness), rätsel (riddle), hilfe (help), entdeckung (discovery), gesicht (face), licht (light), gespenst (ghost), erscheinung (apparition), symbol (symbol), verschwinden (disappear), stimmen (voices), kälte (cold), frieden (peace), wahrheit (truth)**\n\nJohann ging tiefer in die Krypta. Die Schatten wurden länger, und das Flüstern schien ihn zu verfolgen. Er spürte eine Mischung aus Angst und Entschlossenheit. Was konnte dieses Flüstern bedeuten? Wer oder was brauchte seine Hilfe?\n\nEr hielt inne, als er eine Nische in der Wand entdeckte. Darin stand eine kleine Statue einer weinenden Frau, die eine Kerze in den Händen hielt. Die Kerze war ausgebrannt, aber Johann zündete sie mit seiner Laterne wieder an. Sofort flammte ein schwaches Licht auf, und die Schatten tanzten an den Wänden.\n\nNeben der Statue lag ein altes Buch. Der Einband war aus Leder und mit seltsamen Symbolen verziert. Johann öffnete das Buch vorsichtig. Die Seiten waren vergilbt, aber die Schrift war noch lesbar. Es schien eine Art Tagebuch zu sein. Er begann zu lesen:\n\n\"20. März 1765: Heute hat der Pfarrer ein Mädchen aus dem Dorf hierher gebracht. Sie war krank und schwach. Er sagte, sie sei besessen. Wir sperrten sie in die Krypta, um sie zu retten.\"\n\n\"25.

März 1765: Das Mädchen ist tot. Der Pfarrer sagt, ihre Seele sei nun frei. Aber warum fühle ich mich so schuldig? Warum hören die Schreie nicht auf?\"\n\nJohann schluckte schwer. Das Mädchen musste das Flüstern sein, das er hörte. Ihre Seele fand keinen Frieden. Er musste mehr herausfinden. Vielleicht war der Pfarrer der Schlüssel zu diesem Geheimnis.\n\nEr ging weiter durch die Krypta und entdeckte eine alte Tür, die halb geöffnet war. Dahinter führte ein schmaler Gang tiefer in die Dunkelheit. Johann zögerte, dann betrat er den Gang. Das Flüstern wurde lauter, und er konnte nun Worte unterscheiden.\n\n\"Rache... Gerechtigkeit... Frieden...\" Die Stimme des Mädchens klang traurig und verzweifelt.\n\nAm Ende des Ganges fand Johann einen kleinen Raum. In der Mitte des Raumes stand ein weiterer Steinsarg. Auf dem Deckel war der Name des Mädchens eingraviert: \"Maria\". Johann fühlte eine tiefe Traurigkeit. Er wusste, dass er etwas tun musste, um Maria zu helfen.\n\nEr öffnete den Sarg vorsichtig und fand ein Medaillon auf ihrer Brust. Es war mit demselben Symbol verziert wie das Buch. Johann nahm das Medaillon und hielt es in die Höhe. Plötzlich füllte sich der Raum mit einem hellen Licht. Die Gestalt eines Mädchens erschien vor ihm. Es war Maria.\n\n\"Danke,\" flüsterte sie. \"Du hast mich befreit.\"\n\nDoch bevor Johann etwas sagen konnte, verdunkelte sich der Raum wieder. Das Flüstern kehrte zurück, diesmal lauter und wütender. Eine andere Gestalt erschien – ein Mann in einer schwarzen Robe. Es war der Pfarrer.\n\n\"Du wagst es, das Geheimnis zu lüften!\" rief er mit einer donnernden Stimme. \"Du wirst dafür büßen!\"\n\nJohann spürte eine Kälte, die ihn durchdrang. Er wusste, dass der Kampf um Marias Seele noch nicht vorbei war. Er musste stark bleiben und das Geheimnis endgültig lösen.\n\nTeil 3\n\n**gestalt (figure), pfarrer (priest), böse (evil), kämpfen (fight), licht (light), medaillon (medallion), angst (fear), stimmen (voices), frieden (peace), schuld (guilt), mut (courage), überwindung (overcoming), segen (blessing), verdammnis (damnation), geist (spirit), krypta (crypt), sarg (coffin), ruhe (rest), vergangenheit (past), geheimnis (secret), rettung (salvation), leuchten (shine), rufen (call), danke (thank you), erleichterung (relief), dunkelheit (darkness), verschwinden (vanish), wiedergutmachung (atonement), frieden (peace), hoffnung (hope)**\n\nJohann stand vor dem Geist des Pfarrers, der finster und bedrohlich aussah. Die Kälte in der Krypta war beinahe unerträglich. Das Flüstern um ihn herum wurde zu einem unheimlichen Chor. Johann wusste, dass er stark bleiben musste, um Marias Seele zu befreien.\n\n„Warum quälst du sie?“ rief Johann dem Pfarrer entgegen. „Lass sie in Frieden ruhen!“\n\nDer Pfarrer lachte düster. „Maria war besessen. Ihre Seele war verflucht. Ich habe versucht, sie zu retten, aber sie war verloren. Und jetzt werde ich dich auch verlieren.“\n\nJohann hielt das Medaillon fest in seiner Hand. „Du irrst dich. Sie ist unschuldig. Es ist dein Geist, der verdorben ist.“\n\nDer Pfarrer schien für einen Moment zu zögern, aber dann verfinsterte sich sein Gesicht wieder. Er erhob seine Hand, und ein starker Wind begann durch die Krypta zu toben. Johann spürte, wie die Kälte ihn zu überwältigen drohte. Doch er ließ nicht los.\n\n„Maria, ich werde dir helfen!“ rief er aus voller Kehle.\n\nIn diesem Moment erschien die Gestalt des Mädchens wieder. Sie sah Johann an und lächelte traurig. „Du hast mir geholfen, die Wahrheit zu finden,“ sagte sie leise. „Aber nun musst du ihn aufhalten.“\n\nJohann verstand. Er hielt das Medaillon hoch und sprach laut: „Im Namen des Lichts, im Namen der Unschuldigen, befreie diese Seele!“\n\nEin heller Lichtstrahl schoss aus dem Medaillon und traf den Pfarrer. Der Geist des Pfarrers schrie vor Schmerz und versuchte, dem Licht zu entkommen. Doch das Licht umhüllte ihn vollständig, und nach einem letzten, verzweifelten Schrei verschwand er.\n\nDie Krypta wurde plötzlich still. Das Flüstern verstummte, und die Kälte wich einer angenehmen Wärme. Maria lächelte Johann dankbar an. „Danke, dass du mich befreit hast,“ flüsterte sie. „Nun kann ich in Frieden ruhen.“\n\nJohann nickte. „Ruhe in Frieden, Maria.“\n\nDie Gestalt des Mädchens löste sich langsam in Luft auf, und Johann spürte eine tiefe Ruhe in seinem Herzen. Er wusste, dass Marias Seele endlich Frieden gefunden hatte.\n\nMit dem Medaillon in der Hand verließ Johann die Krypta und kehrte in die Kirche zurück. Der Sturm draußen hatte nachgelassen, und der Mond schien durch die zerbrochenen Fenster. Johann fühlte sich erleichtert und dankbar, dass er das Geheimnis der alten Kirche gelüftet hatte.\n\nEr ging zurück ins Dorf und erzählte den Dorfbewohnern, was passiert war. Die Menschen hörten aufmerksam zu und waren erstaunt über seine Mut. Von diesem Tag an wurde die alte Kirche nicht mehr gefürchtet. Sie war nun ein Ort des Friedens und der Erinnerung.\n\nJohann wusste, dass er etwas Wichtiges getan hatte. Er hatte einer verlorenen Seele geholfen und das Böse besiegt. Und in den stillen Nächten, wenn der Wind durch die Bäume flüsterte, wusste er, dass Maria endlich in Frieden ruhte.","created":"2024-07-30 13:48:24.137Z","creatorId":"","id":"2nm8yzgeu022d1j","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/de-kirche.webp","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","STORY"],"title":"Das Geheimnis der alten Kirche","updated":"2024-07-30 14:03:54.709Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/jonas.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"In dem kleinen Dorf Eichenheim herrschte große Aufregung.

Niemand schien es zu wissen.\n\nJonas, ein neugieriger und mutiger Junge, war besonders besorgt. Er war fest entschlossen, das Rätsel zu lösen. Er begann seine Suche, indem er die Gerüchte und Geschichten sammelte, die die Dorfbewohner flüsterten. Einige sprachen von einem Fluch, andere von einem grausamen Zauberer, der die Daumen gestohlen hatte.\n\nJonas' Suche führte ihn in den alten Wald am Rande des Dorfes. Dort traf er auf eine alte Frau, die als Kräuterkundige bekannt war. Sie warnt Jonas vor den Gefahren des Waldes, aber Jonas ist entschlossen, die Wahrheit zu erfahren.\n\nNach einem langen und beschwerlichen Weg findet Jonas eine versteckte Höhle. Im Inneren findet er einen Kessel, der voller seltsamer Zutaten brodelt.

Er hatte einen kleinen Welpen namens Bruno, den er über alles liebte. Bruno war ein verspielter und neugieriger Hund, der immer neue Abenteuer suchte. Eines sonnigen Morgens wachte Max auf und bemerkte, dass Bruno nicht in seinem Körbchen war. Er rief seinen Namen, aber Bruno kam nicht. Max durchsuchte das ganze Haus, von oben bis unten, doch Bruno war nirgends zu finden.\n\nMit wachsender Besorgnis zog Max seine Schuhe an und ging nach draußen. Er lief durch den Garten und rief laut nach Bruno, aber alles, was er hörte, war das Zwitschern der Vögel. Max beschloss, in der Nachbarschaft nach ihm zu suchen. Er klopfte an die Türen seiner Nachbarn und fragte jeden, den er traf, ob sie Bruno gesehen hätten. Leider hatte niemand den kleinen Welpen bemerkt.\n\nAls Max am nahegelegenen Park vorbeikam, fiel ihm etwas Seltsames auf. Auf dem Boden lag Brunos Halsband. Max hob es auf und erkannte sofort, dass es wirklich Brunos war. Doch etwas war anders – das Halsband war schmutzig und hatte einen merkwürdigen, schlammigen Fußabdruck darauf. Max konnte sich keinen Reim darauf machen, was passiert war. Wo konnte Bruno nur sein?\n\nMax setzte sich auf eine Parkbank und dachte nach. Er liebte Bruno sehr und wollte ihn unbedingt finden. Während er da saß, fiel ihm ein, dass er im Park nach weiteren Hinweisen suchen könnte. Vielleicht hatte jemand etwas gesehen oder gehört, das ihm helfen könnte, Bruno zu finden. Entschlossen stand er auf und begann, den Park systematisch zu durchsuchen, immer wieder nach seinem kleinen Freund rufend.\n\n## Teil 2: Die Spurensuche\n\nMax begann, den Park gründlich zu durchsuchen. Er schaute hinter Büsche, unter Bänken und sogar in Mülleimer, aber Bruno war nirgends zu finden. Schließlich traf er auf Frau Müller, die oft im Park spazieren ging. Sie sah Max mit dem Halsband in der Hand und fragte besorgt: \"Hast du deinen kleinen Bruno verloren?\"\n\nMax nickte und zeigte ihr das Halsband. \"Ich habe das hier gefunden, aber ich weiß nicht, wo Bruno ist. Hast du vielleicht etwas gesehen?\"\n\nFrau Müller dachte nach und antwortete: \"Heute Morgen habe ich einen Mann mit einem kleinen Welpen gesehen. Der Welpe sah aus wie Bruno, aber ich bin mir nicht sicher. Der Mann ging in Richtung des Marktplatzes.\"\n\nMax bedankte sich bei Frau Müller und rannte sofort zum Marktplatz. Er hoffte, dort weitere Hinweise zu finden. Der Marktplatz war voller Menschen, die ihre Einkäufe erledigten und sich unterhielten. Max schaute sich um und fragte die Händler, ob sie einen Mann mit einem kleinen Welpen gesehen hätten.\n\nEin Gemüseverkäufer, Herr Schmidt, erinnerte sich: \"Ja, ich habe einen Mann mit einem Welpen gesehen. Der Welpe hat sehr viel gebellt. Der Mann ging in Richtung der alten Brücke.\"\n\nMax fühlte sich aufgeregt und zugleich nervös. Er folgte der Spur zur alten Brücke. Als er dort ankam, sah er nichts Ungewöhnliches. Enttäuscht setzte er sich auf die Brücke und überlegte, was er als Nächstes tun sollte. Plötzlich hörte er ein leises Wimmern.\n\nMax sprang auf und folgte dem Geräusch. Es führte ihn zu einem kleinen Schuppen unter der Brücke. Vorsichtig öffnete er die Tür und zu seiner großen Erleichterung sah er Bruno! Der kleine Welpe war an einen Pfosten gebunden, aber außer ein wenig schmutzig schien er unverletzt zu sein.\n\nMax löste schnell die Leine und nahm Bruno in die Arme. \"Bruno, ich habe dich so vermisst!\", sagte er erleichtert. Aber die Frage blieb: Wer hatte Bruno hierher gebracht und warum?\n\n## Teil 3: Die Aufklärung\n\nMit Bruno sicher in seinen Armen machte sich Max auf den Weg nach Hause. Auf dem Weg dachte er über die Ereignisse nach. Wer hätte Bruno entführen und an den Pfosten binden können? Und warum?\n\nAls Max und Bruno zu Hause ankamen, wartete eine Überraschung auf sie. Ein Polizist, Herr Becker, stand vor der Tür und sprach mit Max' Mutter. \"Max, da bist du ja!\", rief seine Mutter erleichtert. \"Dieser Polizist wollte mit dir sprechen.\"\n\nHerr Becker lächelte Max freundlich an. \"Hallo Max, wir haben eine Meldung über einen verschwundenen Welpen erhalten und ich bin hier, um zu helfen. Aber es sieht so aus, als hättest du Bruno schon gefunden!\"\n\nMax nickte und erzählte Herr Becker die ganze Geschichte – von der Suche im Park bis zum Fund unter der alten Brücke. Herr Becker hörte aufmerksam zu und fragte dann: \"Hast du gesehen, wer Bruno dort angebunden hat?\"\n\nMax schüttelte den Kopf. \"Nein, aber Frau Müller und Herr Schmidt haben einen Mann mit Bruno gesehen. Sie sagten, er ging in Richtung Marktplatz und dann zur alten Brücke.\"\n\nHerr Becker dachte nach und sagte dann: \"Wir sollten Frau Müller und Herr Schmidt noch einmal befragen. Vielleicht können sie den Mann besser beschreiben.\"\n\nGemeinsam gingen sie zurück zum Park, wo sie Frau Müller trafen. Sie beschrieb den Mann als groß und schlank, mit dunklen Haaren und einer blauen Jacke. Herr Schmidt fügte hinzu, dass der Mann eine rote Tasche bei sich hatte.\n\nHerr Becker bedankte sich bei beiden und versprach, nach dem Mann zu suchen. \"Wir werden alles tun, um herauszufinden, wer das getan hat und warum. In der Zwischenzeit, Max, sei bitte vorsichtig mit Bruno und lass ihn nicht aus den Augen.\"\n\nMax versprach es und ging mit Bruno nach Hause. Er war erleichtert, seinen besten Freund wieder bei sich zu haben, und dankbar für die Hilfe seiner Nachbarn und der Polizei. An diesem Abend kuschelte sich Bruno eng an Max, während sie beide friedlich einschliefen.\n\nEnde\n\n","created":"2024-05-31 05:01:44.740Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"djtqe09sx4y5cdz","imageUrl":"","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"Das Geheimnis des verschwundenen Welpen","updated":"2024-05-31 05:01:44.740Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/buch.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Lea fand ein Buch im Park.

Max war Fluglotse, ein Job, der Konzentration, Präzision und Ruhe unter Druck erforderte. Er arbeitete in einem hohen Turm, der die Landebahnen überblickte, wo Flugzeuge aus aller Welt starteten und landeten.\n\nMax liebte seinen Job. Er fühlte sich, als wäre er Teil von etwas Großem und Wichtigem. Jeden Tag half er, den Himmel sicher zu halten, indem er Piloten durch den vollen Luftraum über einem der geschäftigsten Flughäfen der Welt führte. Aber in letzter Zeit fühlte er sich unwohl. Es passierte etwas Seltsames während seiner Nachtschichten.\n\nEines Abends, als Max sich in seine Routine einarbeitete, bemerkte er etwas Ungewöhnliches auf seinem Radar. Ein Punkt erschien, der sich langsam auf den Flughafen zubewegte. Es war kein geplanter Flug, und es antwortete nicht auf seine Anrufe. Max runzelte die Stirn und versuchte es erneut.\n\n\"Unbekanntes Flugzeug, hier ist der Tower Frankfurt. Bitte antworten,\" sagte er in sein Headset. Aber es gab keine Antwort.\n\nMax beobachtete, wie sich der Punkt weiter näherte. Es schien fast geisterhaft, flackerte auf dem Bildschirm. Plötzlich verschwand es. Max blinzelte und fragte sich, ob er sich das nur eingebildet hatte. Er sah sich um, aber seine Kollegen waren alle mit ihren eigenen Aufgaben beschäftigt.\n\nIn der nächsten Nacht passierte es wieder. Der gleiche langsam bewegende Punkt erschien auf dem Radar, ignorierte seine Anrufe und verschwand dann. Max' Neugier wuchs. Er begann ein kaltes Gefühl zu bekommen, wann immer er daran dachte.\n\nIn der dritten Nacht beschloss er, weiter zu forschen. Er beendete seine Schicht und wartete, bis der Kontrollturm ruhig war. Dann ging er in den Wartungsbereich, wo er einen alten Techniker namens Hans fand. Hans arbeitete schon seit Jahrzehnten am Flughafen und wusste alles darüber.\n\n\"Hey Hans,\" sagte Max. \"Kann ich dich etwas fragen?\"\n\n\"Klar, Junge. Was hast du auf dem Herzen?\" antwortete Hans und schaute von seiner Arbeit auf.\n\n\"Hast du schon mal einen seltsamen Punkt auf dem Radar während der Nachtschicht gesehen? Er erscheint aus dem Nichts und verschwindet dann einfach,\" erklärte Max.\n\nHans' Gesicht wurde ernst. Er legte seine Werkzeuge weg und bedeutete Max, sich zu setzen. \"Ich habe es gesehen,\" sagte er leise. \"Es passiert nicht oft, aber wenn es passiert, dann immer während der Nachtschicht.\"\n\nMax beugte sich vor, gespannt auf mehr. \"Was ist das? Weißt du, woher es kommt?\"\n\nHans schüttelte den Kopf. \"Niemand weiß es genau. Einige sagen, es sei ein Geisterflugzeug, ein Flug, der vor Jahren verschwunden ist. Andere denken, es sei eine Störung im System. Aber eine Sache sind sich alle einig: es bringt Unglück.\"\n\n\"Unglück?\" wiederholte Max und fühlte, wie ihm ein Schauer über den Rücken lief.\n\n\"Ja,\" sagte Hans. \"Seltsame Dinge passieren, wenn dieser Punkt auftaucht. Flugzeuge geraten aus der Bahn, Geräte fallen aus, sogar Unfälle. Ich habe alles gesehen. Mein Rat? Halte dich fern davon. Versuche nicht, Kontakt aufzunehmen. Lass es einfach.\"\n\nMax verließ den Wartungsbereich mit einem schweren Herzen. Er konnte das Gefühl nicht abschütteln, dass er beobachtet wurde. In dieser Nacht, als er zu seinem Auto ging, dachte er, einen Schatten hinter sich zu sehen. Er drehte sich um, aber da war nichts. Der Wind heulte durch den leeren Parkplatz, und Max eilte zu seinem Auto und schloss die Türen sofort ab.\n\nWährend er nach Hause fuhr, konnte er nicht aufhören, an den geisterhaften Punkt zu denken. Was, wenn es mehr als nur eine Störung war? Was, wenn es etwas Größeres war? Max wusste, dass er es herausfinden musste, selbst wenn es bedeutete, seine eigene Sicherheit zu riskieren. Er würde das Geheimnis des Geisterflugzeugs lüften, egal, was es kostete.\n\n### Vokabelliste\n\n- **Fluglotse** - eine Person, die Flugzeuge lenkt (air traffic controller)\n- **Konzentration** - Aufmerksamkeit für eine Aufgabe (focus)\n- **Präzision** - Genauigkeit (precision)\n- **Ruhe** - Gelassenheit (calm)\n- **Druck** - Stress (pressure)\n- **Turm** - ein hohes Bauwerk (tower)\n- **Landebahn** - ein Streifen, auf dem Flugzeuge starten und landen (runway)\n- **Radar** - ein System zur Erkennung von Objekten (radar)\n- **Punkt** - ein kleiner Fleck auf dem Radarschirm (blip)\n- **geplant** - geplant (scheduled)\n- **antworten** - antworten (responding)\n- **geisterhaft** - wie ein Geist (ghostly)\n- **flackern** - blinken (flickering)\n- **Kollegen** - Mitarbeiter (colleagues)\n- **Neugier** - Wunsch zu wissen (curiosity)\n- **Wartung** - Instandhaltung (maintenance)\n- **Techniker** - ein Facharbeiter (technician)\n- **Jahrzehnte** - Zeiträume von zehn Jahren (decades)\n- **ernst** - ernsthaft (serious)\n- **Geisterflugzeug** - ein gerüchtemäßiges Phantomflugzeug (ghost plane)\n- **Störung** - eine kleine Fehlfunktion (glitch)\n- **verschwunden** - verschwunden (disappeared)\n- **verschwindet** - verschwindet (vanishes)\n- **Fehlfunktionen** - arbeitet nicht (malfunctions)\n- **Unfälle** - unerwartete Ereignisse, die Schaden verursachen (accidents)\n- **Schatten** - eine dunkle Form (shadow)\n- **lüften** - enthüllen (uncover)\n- **Geheimnis** - etwas Unerklärliches (mystery)\n- **Sicherheit** - Schutz vor Schaden (safety)\n- **Schauer** - ein Zittern aufgrund von Angst oder Kälte (shiver)\n- **Rücken** - die Wirbelsäule (spine)","created":"2024-08-05 13:15:44.404Z","creatorId":"","id":"ds9mvmrj9fm5h9i","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-3.webp","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"Der Signalmann 1","updated":"2024-08-05 13:18:23.529Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/de-signalmann-2.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"### Teil 2: Die Offenbarung\n\nMax konnte das unheimliche Gefühl, das der geisterhafte Punkt hinterlassen hatte, nicht abschütteln. Seine Träume wurden von Visionen von Geisterflugzeugen und leeren Cockpits heimgesucht. Entschlossen, die Wahrheit herauszufinden, verbrachte er seine Freizeit damit, ungewöhnliche Vorfälle im Zusammenhang mit dem Frankfurter Flughafen zu recherchieren.\n\nEines Nachts, als er alte Berichte und Zeitungsartikel durchstöberte, stieß er auf eine Geschichte, die ihm einen Schauer über den Rücken jagte. Es ging um Flug 815, ein Passagierflugzeug, das vor zwanzig Jahren spurlos verschwunden war. Der Flug war auf dem Weg von Frankfurt nach London, kam aber nie an. Trotz einer umfangreichen Suche wurden weder Wrackteile noch Leichen gefunden. Das Rätsel um Flug 815 blieb ungelöst.\n\nMax war überzeugt, dass der geisterhafte Punkt auf seinem Radar irgendwie mit Flug 815 verbunden war. Er beschloss, das Flughafenarchiv zu besuchen, um weiter zu forschen. Die Archive befanden sich in einem schwach beleuchteten Keller unter dem Hauptterminal, einem Ort, den nur wenige besuchten.\n\nAls er die engen Treppen hinunterging, fühlte Max eine Vorahnung. Die Luft war dick mit Staub, und das einzige Geräusch war das leise Summen der Leuchtstofflampen. Er fand den Abschnitt mit den alten Flugunterlagen und begann seine Suche.\n\nStunden vergingen, während er unzählige Akten und Dokumente durchsuchte. Gerade als er aufgeben wollte, fand er einen Ordner mit der Aufschrift \"Flug 815.\" Seine Hände zitterten, als er ihn öffnete. Darin fand er detaillierte Berichte über den Flug, die Besatzung und die Passagiere. Es gab auch Abschriften der letzten Kommunikation zwischen dem Piloten und dem Kontrollturm.\n\nMax' Augen weiteten sich, als er die letzten Worte des Piloten las: \"Wir erleben starke Turbulenzen. Etwas stimmt nicht. Ich sehe... etwas in den Wolken. Es kommt auf uns zu. Mayday! May—\"\n\nDie Übertragung endete abrupt. Max' Herz raste, als er erkannte, dass was auch immer Flug 815 passiert war, es schnell und ohne Vorwarnung geschehen war. Er brauchte mehr Informationen, also suchte er weiter im Ordner.\n\nAm Ende fand er ein Foto, das ihm das Blut in den Adern gefrieren ließ. Es war ein Bild der Kontrollturmbesatzung in der Nacht, als Flug 815 verschwand. Im Hintergrund, kaum sichtbar, war eine schattenhafte Gestalt zu sehen, die neben dem Radarschirm stand. Die Gestalt trug eine altmodische Uniform und hatte eine unheimliche, fast durchscheinende Qualität.\n\nMax wusste, dass er mit jemandem sprechen musste, der in dieser Nacht dort gewesen war. Er fand heraus, dass ein pensionierter Fluglotse namens Peter, der in der Nacht, als Flug 815 verschwand, Nachtschicht hatte, jetzt in einem ruhigen Vorort außerhalb von Frankfurt lebte.\n\nAls Max Peter besuchte, fand er ihn auf der Veranda seines kleinen Hauses sitzend, eine Tasse Kaffee trinkend. Peter war ein alter Mann mit einem freundlichen Gesicht und scharfen Augen, die direkt durch Max hindurchzusehen schienen.\n\n\"Hallo, Peter. Mein Name ist Max. Ich arbeite am Frankfurter Flughafen und habe ein paar Fragen zu Flug 815,\" sagte Max, bemüht, seine Stimme ruhig zu halten.\n\nPeter nickte langsam. \"Ich dachte mir, dass irgendwann jemand nach diesem Flug fragen würde. Komm, setz dich.\"\n\nMax setzte sich neben Peter und zeigte ihm das Foto. \"Erinnerst du dich an diese Nacht?\" fragte er.\n\nPeter nahm das Foto lange in Augenschein und seufzte. \"Ich erinnere mich, als wäre es gestern gewesen. Das war die Nacht, in der sich alles änderte.\"\n\n\"Wer ist diese Gestalt im Hintergrund?\" fragte Max und zeigte auf die schattenhafte Figur.\n\nPeters Ausdruck wurde ernst. \"Wir nannten ihn den Signalmann. Niemand wusste, wer er war oder woher er kam. Er tauchte einfach eines Nachts auf und verschwand, nachdem der Flug verloren ging. Einige sagten, er sei ein Geist, eine Warnung vor drohendem Unheil.\"\n\nMax erschauderte. \"Glaubst du, er hat etwas mit dem geisterhaften Punkt zu tun, den ich auf dem Radar gesehen habe?\"\n\nPeter nickte. \"Das ist möglich. Der Signalmann wurde auch an anderen Flughäfen gesehen, immer vor einer Katastrophe. Wenn du ihn siehst, musst du sehr vorsichtig sein.\"\n\nMax verließ Peters Haus mit schwerem Herzen. Das Geheimnis des Signalmanns und Flug 815 war tiefer, als er sich vorgestellt hatte. Er wusste, dass er wachsam sein musste und die Passagiere und die Besatzung der Flugzeuge, die er leitete, schützen musste. Der geisterhafte Punkt war mehr als nur eine Störung; es war eine Warnung, und er musste einen Weg finden, die drohende Katastrophe zu verhindern.\n\n### Vokabelliste\n\n- **unheimlich** - gruselig (eerie)\n- **Visionen** - Bilder oder Träume (visions)\n- **Cockpits** - Bereiche, in denen Piloten sitzen (cockpits)\n- **entschlossen** - mit festem Entschluss (determined)\n- **ungewöhnlich** - nicht normal (unusual)\n- **Vorfälle** - Ereignisse (incidents)\n- **Berichte** - schriftliche Dokumente (records)\n- **Zeitungsartikel** - schriftliche Stücke in Zeitungen (articles)\n- **Passagier** - ein Reisender in einem Fahrzeug (passenger)\n- **spurlos** - ohne Spur (without a trace)\n- **umfangreich** - großflächig (extensive)\n- **Wrackteile** - Überreste von etwas Zerstörtem (wreckage)\n- **Archive** - ein Ort, an dem Dokumente aufbewahrt werden (archives)\n- **Vorahnung** - Gefühl bevorstehender Unheil (foreboding)\n- **Leuchtstofflampen** - Lampen mit fluoreszierendem Licht (fluorescent lights)\n- **Unterlagen** - schriftliche Dokumente (documents)\n- **Turbulenzen** - unruhige Luftbewegungen (turbulence)\n- **abrupt** - plötzlich und unerwartet (abruptly)\n- **Ordner** - eine Mappe für Dokumente (folder)\n- **schattenhaft** - dunkel und undeutlich (shadowy)\n- **durchscheinend** - Licht durchlassend (translucent)\n- **pensioniert** - nicht mehr arbeitend (retired)\n- **Vorort** - ein Wohngebiet außerhalb einer Stadt (suburb)\n- **scharf** - scharfsinnig oder schnell (sharp)\n- **Gestalt** - eine Form oder Kontur von jemandem (figure)\n- **drohend** - bevorstehend (impending)\n- **Katastrophe** - ein plötzliches Ereignis, das großen Schaden verursacht (disaster)\n- **wachsam** - aufmerksam und alarmbereit (vigilant)\n- **Geheimnis** - etwas Unerklärliches (mystery)\n- **schützen** - vor Schaden bewahren (protect)\n- **warnen** - vor Gefahr benachrichtigen (warn)\n- **Schauer** - ein Zittern aufgrund von Angst oder Kälte (shiver)\n- **scharfsinnig** - klug und schnell denkend (sharp-minded)","created":"2024-08-05 13:14:03.167Z","creatorId":"","id":"xypeaw7ha7yxo76","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-2.webp","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"Der Signalmann 2","updated":"2024-08-05 13:18:16.119Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/de-signalmann-3.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"### Teil 3: Die Konfrontation\n\nMax' Entschlossenheit wuchs. Er musste die drohende Katastrophe, vor der der geisterhafte Punkt warnte, verhindern. Mit den Informationen, die er gesammelt hatte, kehrte er zu seinen Nachtschichten zurück, wachsamer denn je.\n\nIn einer stürmischen Nacht, als Blitze den Frankfurter Himmel erleuchteten, erschien der geisterhafte Punkt wieder auf Max' Radar. Sein Herz raste, aber er war vorbereitet. Er beobachtete den Punkt genau und stellte fest, dass er auf einen bestimmten Flug zusteuerte – Flug 482, auf dem Weg nach London.\n\n\"Flug 482, hier ist der Tower Frankfurt. Kommen Sie?\", rief Max in sein Headset, seine Stimme fest trotz seiner Angst.\n\n\"Wir hören, Tower Frankfurt. Was ist los?\", antwortete der Pilot.\n\n\"Wir haben ein unidentifiziertes Objekt, das sich auf Ihre Position zubewegt. Ändern Sie sofort Ihren Kurs,\" wies Max an.\n\nDer Pilot bestätigte und nahm die notwendigen Anpassungen vor. Max beobachtete den Radarschirm aufmerksam. Der geisterhafte Punkt änderte seinen Kurs und folgte weiterhin Flug 482. Max erkannte, dass der Punkt nicht nur eine Warnung war; er zielte auf den Flug ab.\n\nEntschlossen, die Passagiere zu schützen, wusste Max, dass er schnell handeln musste. Er kontaktierte andere Flüge in der Nähe, schuf Ablenkungen und leitete sie auf unterschiedliche Höhen und Routen. Der Luftraum über Frankfurt wurde zu einem komplexen Puzzle, aber Max' Geschick und Präzision kamen zum Vorschein. Langsam schien der geisterhafte Punkt sein Ziel zu verlieren und flackerte immer unregelmäßiger.\n\nWährend der Sturm draußen tobte, spürte Max eine kalte Präsenz im Kontrollturm. Er blickte sich um und sah die schwache Silhouette des Signalmanns, der neben dem Radarschirm stand. Die Figur war nun klarer zu erkennen, gekleidet in einer altmodischen Fluglotsenuniform, die Augen fest auf Max gerichtet.\n\n\"Was willst du?\", flüsterte Max, ein Schauer lief ihm über den Rücken.\n\nDer Signalmann hob seine Hand und zeigte auf den Radarschirm. Max blickte zurück und sah, dass der Punkt erneut direkt auf Flug 482 zusteuerte. Verzweifelt versuchte er einen letzten Manöver.\n\n\"Flug 482, hier ist der Tower Frankfurt. Steigen Sie sofort auf 35.000 Fuß!\", befahl er.\n\nDer Pilot befolgte die Anweisung, und Max beobachtete, wie das Flugzeug schnell aufstieg. Der geisterhafte Punkt folgte einen Moment lang, flackerte dann heftig und verschwand schließlich vollständig vom Bildschirm. Max atmete tief aus, seine Hände zitterten.\n\nDie Figur des Signalmanns begann zu verblassen, aber bevor sie vollständig verschwand, nickte sie Max ernst zu, als würde sie seine Bemühungen anerkennen. Die kalte Präsenz verschwand, und der Kontrollturm fühlte sich wieder normal an.\n\nMax' Kollegen, die nichts von der geisterhaften Begegnung wussten, gratulierten ihm, dass er eine potenzielle Katastrophe verhindert hatte. Er nickte, zu erschöpft, um zu erklären. Er wusste, dass der geisterhafte Punkt und der Signalmann keine bloßen Einbildungen waren. Sie waren Überreste einer tragischen Vergangenheit, die nach Auflösung suchten.\n\nIn den folgenden Tagen forschte Max weiter und entdeckte, dass der Signalmann ein Fluglotse war, der vor Jahren bei einem tragischen Unfall gestorben war. Sein Geist blieb zurück und versuchte, andere zu warnen und ähnliche Schicksale zu verhindern.\n\nMax' Erfahrung veränderte ihn. Er wurde noch engagierter in seinem Job und sorgte dafür, dass jeder Flug sicher war. Obwohl der geisterhafte Punkt nie wieder auftauchte, blieb Max wachsam, wissend, dass er etwas Unbegreifliches erlebt hatte. Er hatte sich dem Unbekannten gestellt und war stärker daraus hervorgegangen, seine Geschichte nun eine geflüsterte Legende unter seinen Kollegen.\n\nDer Signalmann hatte Frieden gefunden, und so auch Max, der wusste, dass er die Erinnerung einer verlorenen Seele geehrt hatte, indem er die Lebenden schützte.\n\n### Vokabelliste\n\n- **drohende** - bevorstehende (impending)\n- **Katastrophe** - ein plötzliches Ereignis, das großen Schaden verursacht (disaster)\n- **vorbereitet** - bereit (prepared)\n- **beobachten** - genau ansehen (monitor)\n- **bestimmt** - spezifisch (specific)\n- **Pilot** - Flugzeugführer (pilot)\n- **Position** - Lage (position)\n- **Kurs** - Richtung (course)\n- **Anpassungen** - Änderungen (adjustments)\n- **Ziel** - Objekt (target)\n- **Passagiere** - Reisende (passengers)\n- **handeln** - agieren (act)\n- **Ablenkungen** - Umleitungen (diversions)\n- **Luftraum** - der Raum über dem Boden (airspace)\n- **Puzzle** - Rätsel (puzzle)\n- **Geschick** - Fähigkeit (skill)\n- **Präzision** - Genauigkeit (precision)\n- **Präsenz** - Anwesenheit (presence)\n- **Silhouette** - Umriss (silhouette)\n- **altmodisch** - veraltet (old-fashioned)\n- **flüsterte** - leise gesprochen (whispered)\n- **Manöver** - Bewegung (maneuver)\n- **zittern** - leicht beben (tremble)\n- **anerkennen** - zugeben (acknowledge)\n- **Überreste** - Überbleibsel (remnants)\n- **tragische** - traurig (tragic)\n- **Vergangenheit** - frühere Zeit (past)\n- **Auflösung** - Lösung (resolution)\n- **warnen** - auf Gefahr hinweisen (warn)\n- **engagierter** - mehr involviert (dedicated)\n- **geflüsterte** - leise gesagt (whispered)\n- **Legende** - Geschichte (legend)\n- **Ehre** - Respekt zeigen (honor)\n- **schützte** - bewahrte vor Gefahr (protected)\n- **geistert** - spukt (haunted)","created":"2024-08-05 13:12:04.688Z","creatorId":"","id":"se37eaoxsp7fqqv","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-signal-man-3.webp","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["A2","STORY"],"title":"Der Signalmann 3","updated":"2024-08-05 13:18:10.086Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/the-lost-ticket.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Es war ein sonniger Morgen.

Lukas liebte es, die Welt um sich herum zu erkunden und neue Dinge zu entdecken. Eines Tages, als Lukas durch den Wald spazierte, stieß er auf eine alte, verwitterte Tür. Neugierig wie er war, versuchte er die Tür zu öffnen, aber sie war fest verschlossen.\n\n\"Warum ist die Tür verschlossen?\", fragte sich Lukas. \"Wo führt sie hin?\"\n\nLukas beschloss, den Schlüssel zur Tür zu finden. Er suchte im ganzen Dorf, fragte jeden, den er kannte, und durchstöberte sogar die alte Bibliothek. Doch niemand konnte ihm sagen, wo der Schlüssel war.\n\nSchließlich, nach vielen Tagen des Suchens, fand Lukas den Schlüssel versteckt in einem hohlen Baum. Er eilte zurück zur Tür und öffnete sie mit zitternden Händen.\n\nHinter der Tür befand sich ein kleiner, geheimer Garten. In dem Garten wuchsen wunderschöne Blumen, seltene Bäume und bunte Vögel sangen in den Bäumen. Lukas war fasziniert von diesem magischen Ort. Er verbrachte den ganzen Tag damit, den Garten zu erkunden und all seine Wunder zu bestaunen.\n\nAls die Sonne unterging, wusste Lukas, dass er nach Hause gehen musste. Er schloss die Tür hinter sich und versprach, bald wiederzukommen.\n\nAm nächsten Tag ging Lukas wieder in den Wald, um den Garten zu besuchen. Doch als er die Tür erreichte, war sie wieder verschlossen.\n\n\"Warum ist die Tür wieder verschlossen?\", fragte sich Lukas. \"Wo ist der Schlüssel?\"\n\nLukas suchte überall nach dem Schlüssel, aber er konnte ihn nicht finden. Er war traurig und enttäuscht. Er wusste nicht, wie er jemals wieder in den Garten gelangen sollte.\n\nTagelang wanderte Lukas durch den Wald, auf der Suche nach dem Schlüssel. Er gab die Hoffnung nicht auf, den Garten wiederzusehen.\n\nEines Tages, als Lukas am Rande des Waldes stand, sah er einen alten Mann auf sich zukommen. Der Mann trug einen langen, weißen Bart und einen gütigen Blick in den Augen.\n\n\"Warum bist du so traurig, mein Junge?\", fragte der Mann.\n\nLukas erzählte dem Mann von der Tür, dem Garten und dem verlorenen Schlüssel.\n\nDer Mann lächelte. \"Du brauchst keinen Schlüssel, um den Garten zu öffnen\", sagte er. \"Die Tür ist immer für diejenigen geöffnet, die ein reines Herz haben.\"\n\nLukas war verblüfft. Er rannte zurück zur Tür und drückte den Türknauf. Die Tür öffnete sich leicht und Lukas trat in den Garten ein.\n\nVon diesem Tag an besuchte Lukas den Garten jeden Tag. Er lernte die Pflanzen und Tiere kennen und pflegte den Garten mit Liebe und Sorgfalt.\n\nLukas erkannte, dass der Garten nicht nur ein Ort voller Schönheit war, sondern auch ein Ort der Ruhe und des Friedens. Er war dankbar für den alten Mann, der ihm gezeigt hatte, dass die Tür zum Glück immer offen ist, für diejenigen, die es wagen, sie zu öffnen.\n\nCheck your understanding:\nIn a Bavarian village, curious Lukas finds a locked door in the woods.

Das ist ein häufiger Fehler, aber Introversion und Schüchternheit sind nicht dasselbe. Introvertiert zu sein bedeutet auch keineswegs, dass man kein Selbstvertrauen hat. Lass uns mal genauer anschauen, was Introversion wirklich bedeutet und wie sie sich von Schüchternheit oder geringem Selbstbewusstsein unterscheidet.\n\n#### Was ist Introversion?\nIntroversion ist ein Persönlichkeitsmerkmal. Menschen, die introvertiert sind, fühlen sich oft wohler und aufgeladener, wenn sie Zeit alleine oder in kleineren, ruhigeren Umgebungen verbringen. Sie genießen es, allein zu sein und widmen sich gerne Aktivitäten wie Lesen, Zeichnen oder einfach nur Entspannen ohne zu viel äußere Reize. Das bedeutet nicht, dass sie Menschen nicht mögen; sie brauchen einfach mehr Zeit, um nach dem Sozialkontakt wieder aufzutanken.\n\n#### Schüchternheit vs. Introversion\nSchüchternheit bezieht sich eher auf Angst oder Unbehagen in sozialen Situationen. Eine schüchterne Person möchte vielleicht gerne unter Menschen sein, fühlt sich jedoch nervös oder unsicher dabei. Introvertierte Menschen hingegen fühlen sich möglicherweise in sozialen Situationen völlig wohl, ziehen sich jedoch lieber zurück, weil sie die vielen Reize ermüden.\n\nZum Beispiel könnte ein Introvertierter es genießen, Zeit mit Freunden zu verbringen, aber nach ein paar Stunden fühlt er sich erschöpft und möchte nach Hause gehen, um sich zu erholen. Eine schüchterne Person könnte hingegen bereits nervös sein, wenn sie nur an ein Treffen mit Freunden denkt und sich während des Ereignisses Sorgen darüber machen, was andere von ihr denken.\n\n#### Introversion und Selbstbewusstsein\nEs ist auch wichtig zu wissen, dass introvertiert zu sein nicht bedeutet, kein Selbstvertrauen zu haben. Viele Introvertierte sind selbstbewusst und fähig; sie drücken sich nur anders aus. Anstatt laut und extrovertiert zu sein, hören sie vielleicht lieber zu und denken nach, bevor sie sprechen. Sie nehmen sich Zeit, um ihre Gedanken und Ideen zu verarbeiten, bevor sie sie teilen.\n\nEinige der erfolgreichsten Menschen sind Introvertierte – bekannte Schriftsteller, Künstler, Wissenschaftler und sogar CEOs, die lieber hinter den Kulissen arbeiten. Ihr Selbstbewusstsein rührt daher, dass sie sich selbst gut kennen und ihre Stärken nutzen, um erfolgreich zu sein.\n\n#### Akzeptiere deine Introversion\nWenn du introvertiert bist, ist das nichts, was du ändern musst. Es ist einfach ein Teil von dir. Du kannst trotzdem gesellig sein, Freunde finden und Spaß haben – nur auf eine Weise, die zu deiner Energie und Persönlichkeit passt. Es geht darum, ein Gleichgewicht zu finden und zu erkennen, dass jeder anders „auflädt“.\n\nAlso, das nächste Mal, wenn jemand dich als schüchtern bezeichnet oder annimmt, du hättest kein Selbstbewusstsein, weil du gerne Zeit für dich allein verbringst, kannst du ihm erklären, dass Introversion einfach eine andere Art ist, mit der Welt umzugehen. Und das ist vollkommen in Ordnung.","created":"2024-08-21 05:46:33.785Z","creatorId":"","id":"vm6htqvutruu975","imageUrl":"https://www.purplepeoplesreader.com/apps/assets/en-introversion.webp","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","NON-FICTION"],"title":"Introversion: Es ist nicht dasselbe wie Schüchternheit oder mangelndes Selbstbewusstsein","updated":"2024-08-21 06:26:16.053Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/ph.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"\nKant, Nietzsche und Aristoteles vertreten sehr unterschiedliche Moraltheorien.\n\nKant vertritt eine deontologische Ethik, die auf dem kategorischen Imperativ basiert.

Sein Werk umfasst eine Vielzahl von Themen, darunter Erkenntnistheorie, Ethik, Metaphysik und Rechtsphilosophie.\n\n**Erkenntnistheorie**\n\nIn seiner \"Kritik der reinen Vernunft\" (1781) untersucht Kant die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen der menschlichen Erkenntnis. Er argumentiert, dass unsere Erkenntnis durch die Struktur unseres Verstandes begrenzt ist. Wir können nur das erkennen, was uns durch unsere Sinne erscheint, und unsere Vernunft kann nur die Erscheinungen ordnen und verstehen, aber nicht die Dinge an sich.\n\n**Ethik**\n\nKants Ethik, die in der \"Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten\" (1785) und der \"Kritik der praktischen Vernunft\" (1788) dargelegt wird, ist deontologisch, d.h. sie basiert auf der Idee der Pflicht. Das zentrale Prinzip der kantischen Ethik ist der kategorische Imperativ, der besagt, dass man nur nach der Maxime handeln soll, von der man zugleich wollen kann, dass sie ein allgemeines Gesetz werde.\n\n**Metaphysik**\n\nIn der \"Kritik der reinen Vernunft\" grenzt Kant die Möglichkeiten der Metaphysik ein. Er argumentiert, dass wir zwar über die Sinneswelt hinausgehende Begriffe wie Gott, Freiheit und Unsterblichkeit denken können, aber diese Begriffe nicht durch Erfahrung begründen können.\n\n**Rechtsphilosophie**\n\nIn der \"Metaphysik der Rechtslehre\" (1797) entwickelt Kant eine Theorie des Rechts, die auf dem Prinzip der Autonomie basiert. Er argumentiert, dass das Recht aus der Vernunft abgeleitet werden kann und dass es die Freiheit aller Menschen schützen soll.\n\n**Einfluss**\n\nKants Philosophie hatte einen tiefgreifenden Einfluss auf die Entwicklung der westlichen Philosophie. Seine Ideen wurden von zahlreichen Philosophen aufgegriffen und weiterentwickelt, darunter Hegel, Fichte, Schelling und Schopenhauer.\n\n**Kritik**\n\nKants Philosophie wurde auch kritisiert. So wurde zum Beispiel argumentiert, dass der kategorische Imperativ zu formal und unpraktisch sei. Auch seine Trennung zwischen Erscheinung und Ding an sich wurde kritisiert. Dennoch gilt Kant als einer der wichtigsten Philosophen der Aufklärung und sein Werk hat bis heute an Bedeutung nicht verloren.\n\n**Weitere Informationen**\n\n* Wikipedia-Artikel zu Immanuel Kant: [article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant)\n","created":"2024-01-09 09:38:28.866Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"fk05gioji3nlzht","imageUrl":"apps/assets/kant.jpg","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1"],"title":"Kants Philosophie: Eine kurze Einführung","updated":"2024-01-09 09:42:51.753Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/pink-pirate.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Es war einmal ein Pirat namens **Kapitän Pink**, der die Farbe Pink liebte.

Le Guins Kurzgeschichte \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\". Beide Werke thematisieren eine scheinbar utopische Gesellschaft, deren Wohlstand auf dem Leid eines Einzelnen basiert.\n\n**Die Parallelen:**\n\n**Utopisches Äußeres:** In beiden Geschichten erleben die Protagonisten zunächst eine scheinbar perfekte Gesellschaft, frei von Armut, Krankheit und Leid. In Omelas genießen die Bewohner ein idyllisches Leben, während Majalas von technologischem Fortschritt und Wohlstand geprägt ist.\n\n**Dunkles Geheimnis:** Sowohl in Omelas als auch in Majalas wird dieses Glück durch das Elend eines Einzelnen erkauft. In Omelas leidet ein unschuldiges Kind in einem abgelegenen Keller, während in Majalas der \"Erste Diener\" in einem unterirdischen Gefängnis unvorstellbare Qualen erduldet.\n\n**Moralisches Dilemma:** Sobald die Protagonisten von diesem schrecklichen Geheimnis erfahren, sehen sie sich mit einem unmöglichen Dilemma konfrontiert. Genießen sie weiterhin das Privileg ihres Lebens, wissend um den Preis, den es kostet? Oder handeln sie gegen die scheinbar perfekt funktionierende Gesellschaft, um das Leiden des Einzelnen zu beenden?\n\n**Diejenigen, die weggehen:** Beide Geschichten benennen diejenigen, die dieses Dilemma nicht ertragen können, als \"Diejenigen, die weggehen\". In Omelas verlassen manche Menschen die Stadt für ein ungewisses Leben der Freiheit. In Majalas versuchen einige, den Kreislauf des Leids zu durchbrechen, scheitern aber letztendlich.\n\n**Unterschiede:**\n\n**Sci-Fi-Element:** Strange New Worlds fügt der Grundidee ein Sci-Fi-Element hinzu, indem die Leidensquelle in Majalas eine Technologie ist, die den \"Ersten Diener\" benötigt. Omelas hingegen lässt die Ursache des Leids offen.\n\n**Handlungsfokus:** Während sich Le Guins Geschichte mehr auf die philosophische Fragestellung konzentriert, fügt Strange New Worlds eine Handlung mit der Enterprise-Crew hinzu, die versucht, mit der Situation umzugehen.\n\n**Lösung:** \"Lift Us Where Suffering Cannot Reach\" bietet keine endgültige Lösung, während Le Guins Geschichte offenbart, dass das Leiden des Opfers weiterhin notwendig ist, damit die Utopie funktionieren kann.\n\n**Fazit:**\n\nObwohl Strange New Worlds die Geschichte von Le Guin nicht direkt adaptiert, ist der Einfluss von \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\" in \"Lift Us Where Suffering Cannot Reach\" unübersehbar. Beide Werke regen zum Nachdenken an über die moralischen Grenzen des Leidens und die Verantwortung, die wir für jene tragen, die Opfer für unseren Wohlstand bringen.\n","created":"2024-01-13 07:59:25.840Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"bddxkn7dl1zffmp","imageUrl":"apps/assets/walk-away.jpg","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1"],"title":"Lift Us Where Suffering Cannot Reach","updated":"2024-01-13 08:08:37.942Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/luna.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Luna the Shining Unicorn\n\nLuna das leuchtende Einhorn\n\nLuna was a unicorn with a shimmering silver horn.

Jeder Drache, aus Seide und Schuppen gefertigt, glitzerte im Sonnenlicht und trug Glückswünsche für das kommende Jahr.\n\nMia, mit ihrem flauschigen weißen Fell und abenteuerlustigen Geist, sehnte sich danach, an der Freude teilzunehmen.

Gemeinsam erhoben sie sich über die Menge, Mia klammerte sich mit aller Kraft an die Schnurrhaare des Drachens.\n\nMia kicherte, als der Wind ihr Fell kitzelte, und beobachtete die aufgeregten Gesichter unten. Ladenbesitzer winkten, Kinder zeigten ehrfurchtsvoll auf sie, und alle jubelten dem ungewöhnlichen Duo zu.

Der Drache stupste sie sanft mit seiner Schnauze, als wolle er sich verabschieden. Mia wusste, dass sie nicht ewig auf dem Drachen bleiben konnte, aber die Erinnerung an ihren magischen Flug würde sie für immer begleiten.\n\nZurück auf dem Boden schloss sich Mia der Menge an, ihr Herz erfüllt von der Wärme der Feierlichkeiten. Sie hatte ihren eigenen Weg gefunden, Teil des Umzugs zu sein, und erinnerte alle daran, dass selbst die kleinsten Wesen Freude und Abenteuer bringen können. Und so wurde Mia, die kleine Katze, die es wagte, auf einem Drachen zu reiten, zu einer Legende, die unter den Kindern geflüstert wurde, einem Symbol für Mut und die Magie, die sich entfaltet, wenn man den Geist des Neujahrs umarmt.","created":"2024-02-02 02:35:50.586Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"tfc4vu09cutgjy9","imageUrl":"apps/assets/dragon-cat.jpg","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","STORY"],"title":"Mia reitet auf einem Drachen","updated":"2024-02-02 02:39:20.122Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/cat-butterfly.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Ich bin eine Katze, die in einer kleinen Wohnung lebt.

Ich habe dich noch nie gesehen.\n\nSophie: Ja, mein erstes Semester. Und du?\n\nLukas: Zweites Semester. Na dann, willkommen an der Uni!\n\nRecap\nSophie, a new student, meets Lukas in the crowded cafeteria. They discover they're both relatively new to the university.\n\n\n### Dialog 2: Rivalisierende Clubs\n\nSophie: Wirklich? In welchem Club bist du denn?\n\nLukas: Ich bin im Ruderclub. Ist ganz schön hartes Training, aber es macht auch viel Spaß.\n\nSophie: Wow, klingt cool. Ich interessiere mich eigentlich mehr für den Theaterclub.\n\nLukas: Ach ja? Theater ist nicht so mein Ding. Aber vielleicht kannst du mich ja mal zu einer Aufführung überreden.\n\nSophie: Gerne! Aber im Moment bin ich noch total im Stress mit der Orientierungsphase. So viele neue Leute und Veranstaltungen...\n\nLukas: Kann ich verstehen. War bei mir letztes Semester auch so. Aber es wird besser.\n\nSophie: Das hoffe ich! Apropos Veranstaltungen, nächste Woche ist doch die große Party des Fußballclubs. Geht du da hin?\n\nLukas: Eigentlich nicht so mein Fall. Da sind immer viel zu viele Leute und es ist mir zu laut.\n\nSophie: Na ja, ich bin mal gespannt. Ein paar Freunde von mir gehen hin.\n\nLukas: Dann viel Spaß!\n\nSophie: Danke, du auch!\n\nLukas: Moment mal... du sagst Fußballclub? Meinst du den FC Blau-Weiß?\n\nSophie: Ja, genau den.\n\nLukas: Oh nein! Sophie, du kannst doch nicht auf die Party von denen gehen!\n\nSophie: Wieso denn nicht?\n\nLukas: Weil die die Erzrivalen von unserem Ruderclub sind!\n\nSophie: Ach was? So ein Quatsch!\n\nLukas: Nein, im Ernst! Es gibt zwischen den Clubs eine lange Geschichte voller Hass und Misstrauen.\n\nSophie: Das klingt ja wie Romeo und Julia!\n\nLukas: Kannst du das bitte ernst nehmen? Wenn du da auf die Party gehst, dann...\n\nSophie: Dann was?\n\nLukas: Dann... dann kann ich nicht mehr mit dir befreundet sein!\n\nSophie: Lukas, du spinnst doch!\n\nLukas: Nein, ich spinne nicht! Es ist ernst!\n\nSophie: Okay, okay... ich werde mir das noch mal überlegen.\n\nLukas: Danke, Sophie. Das ist mir wichtig.\n\n#### In English:\n\nLukas is shocked to learn that Sophie is interested in joining the rival football club. He warns her of the long-standing feud between the clubs and threatens to end their friendship if she goes to the party. Sophie is taken aback by his reaction and promises to reconsider.\n\n### Dialog 3: Eine Brücke bauen\n\nSzene: Die Mensa am nächsten Tag.\n\nSophie sieht sich suchend um und entdeckt Lukas winkend an seinem üblichen Tisch. Entschlossen geht sie auf ihn zu.\n\nSophie: Hey Lukas, darf ich mich kurz dazusetzen?\n\nLukas: (zögerlich) Klar... ähm, was ist los?\n\nSophie: Ich habe über gestern nachgedacht. Du hast Recht, diese Rivalität zwischen den Clubs... das ist doch albern.\n\nLukas: (erleichtert) Ach ja? Das siehst du auch so?\n\nSophie: Auf jeden Fall. Wir sind doch alle hier an der Uni, um Spaß zu haben und Freunde zu finden, da ist kein Platz für solchen Blödsinn.\n\nLukas: Super, dass du das sagst! Und ich muss mich auch entschuldigen... meine Reaktion war übertrieben.\n\nSophie: Keine Sorge. Wie wär's denn... wir denken uns mal was aus, wie wir die Leute von unseren Clubs zusammenbringen können?\n\nLukas: Hm... vielleicht irgendwie ein sportlicher Wettkampf, aber etwas Lustiges. Nicht zu ernst.\n\nSophie: Ich glaub, da fällt mir was ein! Wie wäre es mit einem Drachenbootrennen? Da braucht man Teamwork, die Boote sind bunt, vielleicht können wir sogar Kostüme machen...\n\nLukas: Das klingt richtig gut! Lass uns mal rumfragen, ob andere das auch cool finden. Und dann brauchen wir Sponsoren...\n\nSophie: Wir könnten Kuchen verkaufen!\n\nLukas:  Oder T-Shirts mit einem witzigen Logo entwerfen?\n\nAn diesem Punkt hört ein älterer Student, Jonas, zufällig das Gespräch.\n\nJonas:  Hört sich ja spannend an, was habt ihr zwei vor?\n\nLukas und Sophie erklären ihm ihre Idee.\n\nJonas: Also, ich bin in der Rudermannschaft und find das genial! Lass uns mal den Vorstand überzeugen...\n\n#### In English:\n\nSophie approaches Lukas to apologize for their tiff and suggests finding a way to unite their rival clubs. Brainstorming leads to the idea of a fun drachenboot competition, piquing the interest of another student in Lukas's club.\n\n### Dialog 4: Unerwartete Widerstände\n\nSzene: Eine Woche später am Treffpunkt der Theatergruppe\n\nSophie: Hey Leute, ich habe da eine Idee…\n\nSophie erklärt ihre Idee des Drachenbootrennens zwischen den rivalisierenden Sportclubs. Die anfängliche Reaktion ist positiv.\n\nJulia:  Finde ich cool!  Mal was anderes als die üblichen Partys.\n\nTom: Klingt nach echt viel Spaß und Abwechslung. Wann soll das stattfinden?\n\nSophie: Ich dachte an den Sommer, so als Abschlussfest vor den Ferien. Braucht halt etwas Vorlaufszeit.\n\nMarco: Aber mal ernsthaft…glaubst du wirklich, die Ruderer machen da mit? Das sind doch solche Sportskanonen, die werden uns Theaterleute höchstens verlachen.\n\nSophie:  Genau deswegen sollten wir es tun! Um irgendwelche Vorurteile abzubauen.  Außerdem hab ich schon mit Lukas geredet und ein paar Ruderer scheinen interessiert zu sein.\n\nJulia: Dann sollten wir mal zum Fußballclub gehen und denen die Idee pitchen! Hab da sowieso noch einen Freund, vielleicht zieht der mit.\n\nZwei Tage später am Ruderboot-Trainingsgelände\n\nLukas: Okay Leute, hört mal zu. Ich hab' 'nen Vorschlag. Nicht gleich lachen…\n\nLukas erläutert den Plan des Drachenbootrennens. Er trifft auf ein geteiltes Echo.\n\nJonas: Wie schon gesagt, ich finde das mega witzig. Ein bisschen Spaß mit den anderen muss sein.\n\nRobert: Also ich bin raus.  Will nicht mit den Fußballern in einem Boot sitzen. Die können doch mal gar nix richtig.\n\nMelanie: Könnte peinlich werden.  Was, wenn die uns völlig versenken?\n\nLukas: Kommt schon, es ist doch nur ein Rennen!  Und vielleicht merkt ihr ja, dass die gar nicht so uncool sind.\n\nSophie: Genau, es geht darum, gemeinsam Spaß zu haben.  Lasst's uns einfach mal versuchen!\n\n#### Recap \n\nSophie and Lukas pitch their idea to their respective clubs and face mixed reactions. Some are enthusiastic, while others express skepticism and reluctance towards working with their rivals.","created":"2024-02-28 07:23:20.669Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"amwuzm1fzjh2www","imageUrl":"","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["A2"],"title":"Sophie & Lukas","updated":"2024-02-28 07:37:02.880Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/science-questions-01-de.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"## Was ist eine Dyson Sphere?\nEine Dyson-Kugel ist eine hypothetische Megastruktur, die einen Stern umgibt und einen großen Teil seiner Sonnenenergie einfängt. Der Begriff ist ein Gedankenexperiment, das sich damit beschäftigt, wie eine Raumfahrer-Zivilisation ihren Energiebedarf decken würde, wenn dieser die Ressourcen des Heimatplaneten übersteigt. Der Begriff wurde erstmals von dem Physiker Freeman Dyson in seinem 1960 erschienenen Artikel \"Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation\" vorgestellt. Dyson spekulierte, dass solche Strukturen die logische Konsequenz des eskalierenden Energiebedarfs einer technologischen Zivilisation wären und für ihr langfristiges Überleben notwendig wären. Eine Signatur solcher Kugeln, die in astronomischen Suchen entdeckt wurden, könnte ein Indikator für außerirdisches Leben sein.\n\n## Was ist das Fermi-Paradoxon?\nDas Fermi-Paradoxon ist ein Gedankenexperiment, das sich mit der Frage beschäftigt, warum wir trotz der hohen Wahrscheinlichkeit für das Vorhandensein von intelligentem Leben im Universum noch keine Beweise dafür gefunden haben. Es ist paradox, weil es auf der einen Seite sehr wahrscheinlich ist, dass es intelligentes Leben im Universum gibt, aber auf der anderen Seite haben wir noch keine Beweise dafür gefunden. Es gibt viele Theorien, die versuchen, das Fermi-Paradoxon zu erklären, wie zum Beispiel die Hypothese, dass wir noch nicht lange genug suchen, oder dass wir nicht in der Lage sind, die Signale von außerirdischen Zivilisationen zu erkennen. Eine weitere Theorie besagt, dass es eine Art \"großen Filter\" gibt, der verhindert, dass intelligente Zivilisationen überhaupt entstehen oder sich ausbreiten können. Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit, dass wir einfach nicht wissen, wonach wir suchen sollen, oder dass wir uns in unserer Suche auf die falschen Dinge konzentrieren. Das Fermi-Paradoxon bleibt ein faszinierendes Rätsel, das Wissenschaftler und Laien gleichermaßen beschäftigt.\n\n\n## Warum gilt es als unmöglich, schneller als das Licht zu reisen?\nDie spezielle Relativitätstheorie von Albert Einstein besagt, dass nichts und niemand schneller als das Licht reisen kann. Dies liegt daran, dass die Lichtgeschwindigkeit eine fundamentale Konstante des Universums ist und die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich Informationen ausbreiten. Wenn ein Objekt mit Masse versucht, die Lichtgeschwindigkeit zu erreichen, würde seine Energie und sein Impuls unendlich zunehmen, was unmöglich ist. Es gibt viele Theorien, die versuchen, die Möglichkeit von Überlichtgeschwindigkeit zu erklären, aber bisher gibt es keine experimentellen Beweise dafür.\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 1/3/2024\n\n\n","created":"2024-01-03 07:55:53.412Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"2lzkah45je14qla","imageUrl":"apps/assets/space.jpg","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1"],"title":"Space Questions 01","updated":"2024-01-03 08:02:36.233Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/spiel-wasser.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Es war ein heißer Sommertag, und Mia und Tom wollten sich abkühlen.

Q ist fasziniert von den Menschen und ihren Bemühungen, das Universum zu erforschen.

Er hat auch eine besondere Beziehung zu Captain Picard, den er als seinen Lieblingsfeind betrachtet.\n\nHier sind die verschiedenen Star Trek Captains, die Q getroffen oder beobachtet hat, in chronologischer Reihenfolge:\n\n**Captain Jonathan Archer** - Er war der erste Captain der USS Enterprise NX-01, dem ersten Warp-5-Schiff der Erde. Er war ein Pionier der Raumfahrt und spielte eine wichtige Rolle bei der Gründung der Vereinigten Föderation der Planeten. Q hat ihn nie persönlich getroffen, aber er hat seine Abenteuer aus der Ferne verfolgt. Q fand ihn mutig, aber naiv, und er war amüsiert über seine Konflikte mit den Klingonen, den Romulanern und den Xindi.\n\n**Captain Christopher Pike** - Er war der zweite Captain der USS Enterprise NCC-1701, nachdem er Captain Robert April abgelöst hatte. Er war ein erfahrener und respektierter Anführer, der sich durch mehrere gefährliche Situationen bewährte. Er wurde später schwer verletzt und gelähmt, als er eine Gruppe von Kadetten vor einer Strahlenexplosion rettete. Q hat ihn ebenfalls nie persönlich getroffen, aber er war beeindruckt von seinem Mut und seiner Loyalität. Er bedauerte sein tragisches Schicksal, aber er war auch neugierig, wie er sich in einer alternativen Zeitlinie entwickelte, in der er von Spock gerettet wurde.\n\n**Captain James T. Kirk** - Er war der dritte und berühmteste Captain der USS Enterprise NCC-1701. Er war ein charismatischer und kühner Anführer, der viele Erstkontakte, Schlachten und Entdeckungen machte. Er war auch bekannt für seine Affären mit vielen Frauen, sowohl menschlichen als auch außerirdischen. Q hat ihn einmal getroffen, als er ihn und seine Crew in eine tödliche Simulation des amerikanischen Bürgerkriegs versetzte.

Der Mond schien schwach durch die Wolken, und die Straßen waren leer. Emma zog ihren Mantel enger um sich und ging schneller.\n\nPlötzlich hörte sie Schritte hinter sich. Sie drehte sich um, aber niemand war zu sehen. Ihr Herz begann schneller zu schlagen. Sie ging weiter und hörte die Schritte wieder. Diesmal waren sie näher. \n\nEmma beschloss, eine Abkürzung durch den Park zu nehmen. Sie hoffte, den Verfolger abzuschütteln. Der Park war dunkel und still. Nur das Rauschen der Blätter im Wind war zu hören. Die Schritte folgten ihr weiterhin. Sie fing an zu rennen.\n\nPlötzlich sah sie eine Gestalt im Schatten. Es war ein großer Mann mit einem Hut. Emma konnte sein Gesicht nicht erkennen. Sie drehte sich um und rannte in die andere Richtung. Ihr Atem ging schnell, und ihr Herz klopfte laut.\n\n„Warum folgt er mir?“, dachte Emma panisch. Sie sah sich um und entdeckte ein kleines Café, das noch geöffnet war. Schnell lief sie hinein und schloss die Tür hinter sich. Der Mann blieb draußen stehen und starrte durch das Fenster.\n\nDie Kellnerin im Café bemerkte Emmas Angst. „Geht es Ihnen gut?“, fragte sie. Emma nickte und versuchte zu lächeln, aber ihre Hände zitterten. Sie setzte sich an einen Tisch und beobachtete den Mann, der langsam zur Tür ging und eintrat.\n\nEmma hielt den Atem an, als der Mann auf sie zukam. „Entschuldigen Sie“, sagte er und reichte ihr etwas. Es war ihr Portemonnaie, das sie unterwegs verloren hatte. „Ich wollte Ihnen das zurückgeben. Ich habe versucht, Sie einzuholen.“\n\nErleichtert nahm Emma ihr Portemonnaie entgegen. „Danke“, sagte sie und lächelte. Der Mann nickte und ging zur Theke, um einen Kaffee zu bestellen. Emma fühlte sich nun viel besser und war froh, dass alles gut ausgegangen war.\n\nNach einigen Minuten plauderten Emma und der Mann, der sich als Herr Schmidt vorstellte, fröhlich über das Leben in der Stadt. Sie verabschiedeten sich freundlich, und Emma nahm ein Taxi nach Hause. In ihrem Zimmer angekommen, konnte sie endlich durchatmen.\n\nSeit dieser Nacht achtete Emma mehr auf ihre Sachen, aber sie hatte auch das Vertrauen in die Freundlichkeit der Menschen wiedergefunden.\n\n---\n\n**Vokabelliste:**\n\n- Nacht (night)\n- Mond (moon)\n- Wolken (clouds)\n- Straßen (streets)\n- Mantel (coat)\n- Schritte (steps)\n- Herz (heart)\n- schneller schlagen (to beat faster)\n- Abkürzung (shortcut)\n- Park (park)\n- Rauschen (rustling)\n- Blätter (leaves)\n- Gestalt (figure)\n- Schatten (shadow)\n- Gesicht (face)\n- Richtung (direction)\n- Atem (breath)\n- Café (café)\n- Tür (door)\n- Kellnerin (waitress)\n- Angst (fear)\n- Hände (hands)\n- Minuten (minutes)\n- Portemonnaie (wallet)\n- Theke (counter)\n- plauderten (chatted)\n- fröhlich (happily)\n- verabschiedeten (said goodbye)\n- Vertrauen (trust)\n- Freundlichkeit (kindness)\n- Menschen (people)\n- Sachen (belongings)\n- wiedergefunden (regained)","created":"2024-07-28 13:42:09.816Z","creatorId":"","id":"hqbpaocu3hgn304","imageUrl":"de-night-follower.webp","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","STORY"],"title":"Verfolgt in der Nacht","updated":"2024-07-28 13:42:09.816Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/entropy.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"\n„Entropie ist ein Maß für die Unordnung oder Energieverteilung in einem System. Ein System mit hoher Entropie ist ungeordnet und hat eine gleichmäßige Energieverteilung, während ein System mit niedriger Entropie geordnet ist und eine ungleichmäßige Energieverteilung hat.\n\nEntropie ist ein wichtiger Begriff in der Thermodynamik, wo sie verwendet wird, um den zweiten Hauptsatz der Thermodynamik zu beschreiben, der besagt, dass die Entropie eines geschlossenen Systems immer mit der Zeit zunimmt. Das bedeutet, dass geschlossene Systeme dazu neigen, von geordneten zu ungeordneten Zuständen überzugehen.\n\nDer Begriff Entropie wird auch in anderen Bereichen wie der Informationstheorie und der Computerwissenschaft verwendet. In der Informationstheorie wird Entropie verwendet, um das Maß an Unsicherheit in einem Datensatz zu messen. In der Informatik wird Entropie verwendet, um die Komplexität eines Algorithmus zu messen.\n\nEntropie ist ein grundlegendes Konzept mit Anwendungen in vielen verschiedenen Bereichen. Es ist ein leistungsstarkes Werkzeug zum Verständnis der Welt um uns herum.“\n\n\n## Sind Schwarze Löcher entropisch?\n\nJa, Schwarze Löcher sind entropisch. Die Entropie eines Schwarzen Lochs ist proportional zur Fläche seines Ereignishorizonts. Der Ereignishorizont ist die Grenze um ein Schwarzes Loch, von der aus nichts, nicht einmal Licht, entkommen kann. Je größer die Oberfläche des Ereignishorizonts ist, desto mehr Entropie kann das Schwarze Loch enthalten.\n\nDie Entropie eines Schwarzen Lochs kann auf verschiedene Weise verstanden werden. Eine Möglichkeit besteht darin, die Entropie als Maß für die Anzahl der möglichen Zustände zu betrachten, in denen sich ein System befinden kann. Ein Schwarzes Loch mit einer großen Oberfläche kann sich in einer viel größeren Anzahl von Zuständen befinden als ein Schwarzes Loch mit einer kleinen Oberfläche.\n\nEine andere Möglichkeit, die Entropie eines Schwarzen Lochs zu verstehen, besteht darin, sie als Maß für die Unordnung eines Systems zu betrachten. Ein Schwarzes Loch mit einer großen Oberfläche ist ungeordneter als ein Schwarzes Loch mit einer kleinen Oberfläche.\n\nDie Entropie Schwarzer Löcher ist wichtig, weil sie unser Verständnis der Physik Schwarzer Löcher und ihrer Beziehung zur Thermodynamik beeinflusst. Beispielsweise legt die Entropie Schwarzer Löcher nahe, dass Schwarze Löcher Hawking-Strahlung abgeben, eine Art Strahlung, die von der Oberfläche Schwarzer Löcher emittiert wird.\n\nDie Entropie Schwarzer Löcher ist auch wichtig für unser Verständnis des Universums als Ganzes. Da Schwarze Löcher sehr entropisch sind, können sie dazu beitragen, die Entropie des Universums zu erhöhen. Dies könnte letztendlich zum Wärmetod des Universums führen, einem hypothetischen Zustand, in dem das Universum maximal entropisch ist und keine freie Energie mehr für die Arbeit zur Verfügung steht.“\n\nSource: Bard 2023","created":"2024-01-04 07:36:21.054Z","creatorId":"o9d1bw2o9qr6gms","id":"j2dk2x7uwb4v711","imageUrl":"apps/assets/blackhole.jpg","language":"German","shareable":true,"tags":["B1","SCIENCE"],"title":"Was ist Entropie?","updated":"2024-01-04 07:46:27.853Z","videoUrl":"","vocabulary":""},{"audioUrl":"apps/assets/meditation.mp3","collectionId":"1xo43ckkjjmw2fa","collectionName":"lessons","content":"Meditation bezeichnet eine Gruppe von Geistesübungen, die in verschiedenen Traditionen seit Jahrtausenden überliefert sind.
